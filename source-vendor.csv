The account did not include any monthly service fees for having a direct deposit each month. At the one year mark around XXXX 2016 I visited the branch due to deposit issues and a misplaced direct deposited check from SSI which was somehow routed into a closed account ( i believe which was previously suspected to be compromised when charges I did not authorize began to occur ) My direct deposit was ultimately located but once that was resolved I also began to see monthly service charges that were not agreed upon, with the switch to a new and secured account, I was then not allowed the new account features as agreed upon. Staff stated my account had not been open a year, then once I escalated the concern to show what occurred, they then stated it was not in good standing due to overdraft charges ... but the overdraft charges were due to debit transactions that had been processing out of sequence or very delayed ( even though I tracked and managed my spending not to mention had been complimented by Bank teller employees about the good standing and mngmt of my account ) yet resulted in multiple overdraft fees mostly for reasons I could not decypher or was able to predict. Also, I was unable to process my car payment due to continued limits on my account ; the amount was declined to process on time resulting in fees to my lending company, so I immediately closed the account because of nit being able to have access to my own money in order to pay bills and the fact that Management refused to fully refund my money for their transaction processing errors resulting in multiple over draft fees. They would only agree to proving me with a portion of the costs despite lengthy conversations by phone, I was then instructed to just go into the branch and handle it with management. There was an issue with my car payment which actually DID then process after my account closure! & Fees added after the fact..I had to dispute this because it resukted in a dual car payment to my lender.

They may choose to spend the next 20 years fighting for a lower APR by constantly charging higher APR credit cards that they qualify for, take out several loans, store credit cards, trying hard just to maintain their credit and perhaps never reach a 6 % APR?

I was approved for the account and Citi sent me a disclosure indicating what the requirements for meeting the terms of the agreement. The next day, on XXXX XXXX, I found another offer on the internet with a bonus of XXXX points. So I logged into my Citi account and sent them a short message asking if I could instead obtain this bonus. They said no, but they made no mention that I was ineligible for the existing XXXX point bonus I 'd signed up for. This would have been the perfect opportunity to say, "" I 'm sorry, but it seems that you do n't actually qualify for this offer because you were n't "" targeted. '' Surely Citi knew at that time my offer code was one that came from the Internet. But Citi did not do this. I received my debit card soon after. However my PIN number never arrived, so I could n't activate the card and start using it to make the online bill payments in two consecutive months within 60 days of opening the account. I was worried that I might not have enough time to meet the terms, so I called Citi and requested a new PIN number around XXXX XXXX. While I was on the phone, the helpful Citi representative reminded me what I needed to do in order to receive the bonus. This would have been the perfect time to say, "" I 'm sorry, but it appears that you were n't targeted for this offer, so you wo n't be receiving any Thank You points. '' But he did n't. Instead he assured me of what steps I 'd need to take to receive the offer. I told him that I was afraid that because the PIN was so late in coming, maybe I would n't be able to have two consecutive bill payments in the first 60 days. He said he 'd make a note in my account and be sure that I 'd still be able to receive it, strongly implying he both considered me eligible and that I 'd have more time. I was finally able to activate the card and fund the account on XXXX XXXX. ( see statements ). I submitted bill payments on XXXX XXXX and XXXX and XXXX XXXX, within 60 days of funding it ( as the representative I spoke with said I must do ). Certainly if Citi realized I was ineligible for the promotion I signed up with, they should have just told me BEFORE I met the conditions and started paying monthly fees. But, never did Citi indicate that I had been denied until took the initiative on XXXX XXXX to contact Citi to ask when the points would be posted. But neither of these things happened. Instead, Citi took my $ 30 monthly fee and gave me no indication that I would not be receiving the sign-up bonus until six months after I 'd signed up. This is deceptive. On top of that, in XXXX, when I sent a series of secure online messages to ask about this, Citi repeatedly told me that I was ineligible because I was n't targeted. However, they did n't address any of my questions about how Citi had already indicated either directly or indirectly on multiple occasions that I was eligible, even if I was n't targeted. They should n't have posted the notice on their website if they did n't want targeted people to apply. Anyone can run a web search and find it. Unfortunately it does n't seem to be active anymore. I asked twice for representatives to elevate my complaint to a manager. One time, they merely re-investigated and declared me un-targeted, thus ineligible. On XXXX XXXX, 2016 they said they 'd elevate it again to a manager, but I 've heard nothing from them in the last week.

I flew to XXXX on XXXX XXXX to take care of everything that must be done in a tragic situation such as this, including asking Wells Fargo to place a debit hold on her checking/savings accounts until I could sort out her affairs ( I have access to both ). Once I had taken care of the funeral home, personal items and apartment in XXXX, I was able to review her financial matters after returning home to XXXX. My daughter was only XXXX years old, and naturally did not have a will at that age. She had never married and never had any children. She had been living in XXXX for about XXXX years, but only 9 months in the XXXX area. Once I had settled all of her finances, including depositing her last paycheck, the refunds I received from her car and medical insurance companies and the deposit from her apartment, I brought all of my documentation proving my relationship to XXXX ( see attached ) to the Wells Fargo bank in XXXX, XXXX. There was was told that once 45 days had passed I just needed to provide a "" small estate affidavit '' to close her account. I researched the small estate rules for XXXX ( see attachment ) and learned my daughter did not have enough money to cover her liabilities ( after my deposits {$1600.00} total combined in Checking/Savings ) so she does not quality. I also researched probate and discovered the cost of just opening probate for an estate without a will is {$2500.00}, again she did not qualify as the total sum of her estate is nearly {$1000.00} less than that. I then contacted a probate attorney in XXXX for advise on what was needed to prove that as the single adoptive parent I was her only heir, so her funds could be put toward her funeral home bill ( {$4000.00} see attached ). The probate attorney in XXXX advised me that nothing more than notarized affidavits from XXXX dis-interested parties who had known my daughter since childhood attesting to the fact that she had never married and never had children should be needed. Anything beyond that would cost more than the amount of money in her 'estate '. I paid the attorney {$400.00} to prepare those affidavits and XXXX witnesses who had known my daughter since childhood had them signed and notarized. I returned to Wells Fargo bank and was then told that the documentation provided was not sufficient because the amount of money in the account was over {$1000.00}, I would need court statement naming me the heir instead. I contacted the attorney in XXXX and she informed me she had no knowledge of any such limitation or rule in XXXX law. I asked her how much it would cost for a court document and she quoted me attorney fees of {$2000.00} plus $ XXXX {$750.00} additional fees and the need for me to travel to Texas for the proceeding - clearly exceeding ( by far ) the amount of funds in my daughter 's accounts ( see attached ). I contacted the XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX and spoke with numerous individuals, none of which knew of any {$1000.00} limit within XXXX law nor whom found an estate with only {$1600.00} to be feasible to process through any court proceedings. There are no provisions in XXXX for the filing of a court defined heir by the heir. At this point I contacted the XXXX Attorney General 's office for their help. They advised me to log a complaint with Wells Fargo, The Treasure Department/Comptroller of Currency and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau because none of this makes sense - to expect an heir to spend more money to obtain proof of heirship than is available to be recovered.

XXXX explained there was nothing more she could do to help me & I would have to call back the next day to talk with a supervisor or senior agent as they had all already left for the day. I then asked XXXX to close my XXXX savings accounts & transfer the money to my checking account. She further explained that she was n't able to do that because when the final account of a product type is being closed a supervisor or senior agent must complete the transaction. I am not sure the purpose of having the call center open for customers when the agents can not assist with anything is an effective way to manage member money.

XXXX stated no, anyone can do it but the accounts can not be closed with transactions being processed in last 24 hours.

Everything was going fine. I had not overdrawn my account or did anything that I know of that was wrong. I was in a car accident and received an {$8000.00} check from an insurance company, which I deposited into my account. Part of this money was to go back to my parents to pay medical bills and other costs relating to my accident. The bank said there would be a 10 day hold on the check after which I would have access to it. The next day I tried to log on to online banking and was unable to do so because my password would not work. I called the bank and they said that they closed my account. They would not give me anymore information. That day I went into my bank and talked to a live person, who said the same thing, which was they could n't tell me why. I was concerned about the {$8000.00} deposit I had just made and the banker reassured me that they would be mailing me a cashier 's check for the money that was in my account in 10 days. That has not happened. My mother and I called Chase again asking about my money that they have been holding for over 2 weeks and also for an explanation as to why they closed my account. They still did not have any information or would not tell us anything. My parents are being harrassed by XXXX different medical facilities who are demanding payment from my accident. They can not pay them until I get MY money back from Chase. Can this possibly be legal? How can it take so long for them to give me my money back. I should have gotten it back the minute they closed my account. I ca n't afford an attorney but I need some help from someone who knows this kind of thing. The car accident I was in was not my fault. I was banged up pretty bad but the worst part was my car was totaled. I had it for one year and had been fixing it up the whole time. The car was finally perfect and I got to enjoy it for 8 months before a bad driver smashed it up. I was very stressed and sad for 2 months. I finally got some money for my "" inconvenience '' from the other insurance company, which made me happy. I deposited this into my Chase account. After paying my medical bills, I was going to get to keep the rest of the money. I thought I would now be able to put the memories of my bad car accident behind me and move on. But, Chase Bank is preventing me from doing just that. Chase Bank is now causing me and my family a lot of stress all over again. I talked to another banker where I opened my new account and asked them how this could happen. They said usually there are XXXX reasons a bank will close someone 's account. Fraud or not getting along with the customer. I certainly have n't committed any fraud and I have never set foot into Chase Bank except for the day XXXX opened my account several months ago and again several weeks ago to inquire about my account getting closed.

SInce we are in XXXX, the XXXX claims office handle our dispute. Also, back on in XXXX XXXX I had a claim on two previous laptops which were settled with no problem. Now, XXXX XXXX was our claims adjuster. She was very brief and got back to us as soon as possible. I submitted everything showing the cause ( dropped, even though a power surge failure was listed ) she asked and then informed be itll be 5-7 business days for review. Well, that passed up and I began to get concerned. I called to speak with a manager, XXXX, whom was very helpful.She mentioned that someone ( I assumed our claim adjuster since that was the only person who we were communicating with ) was supposed to call and inform us that they needed to get a recorded statement from me, XXXX XXXX. That was handled within the same day. What frustrated me was that XXXX did not relate that information to me, as we literally spoke that day in regards to the claim then I had to ask for her manager. During the recorded statement, she asked why would I have 4 laptops? Well, convenience in our case especially for different purposes. I insinuated that there was some judgement within that. However, once we finished she informed me that it 'll be forwarded to our stateside office since thats who requested it. Into week 3, I recieved an initial contact from XXXX who was the special investigator who I assumed was the one who requested the recorded statement. Furthermore, I returned XXXX phone call 2 days in a row in which he did contact me the third day stating that he has training all that week and would get back to me once he return. Now, it has been 3 1/2 going on 4 weeks. FINALLY, I speak to him and he asks for a recorded statement. WOW!! seriously, so I mentioned ( several times ) that I had already did one with XXXX from the XXXX office here in XXXX. Well, we could never really get a good time to talk over the phone and he insisted that my husband, the policy holder, XXXX should be present. Which is/was very difficult with the time zone difference and being that my husband is military. After a few attempts, XXXX informed me that he 'll have one of their colleagues to assist whom is XXXX Who is here in XXXX.

I spoke with XXXX and we agreed upon a date to meet which was too soon for him being that he has other clients. I expressed my frustration with the claim and he began to get very disrespectful after I informed who that we could possibly do a phone interview ( to speed things up ). He insisted that he HAD to meet with my husband and a phone interview was not permitted. Okay, so I suggested Monday and that XXXX was initiating telephone contact but as stated above it was hard to negotiate time. Once XXXX became disrespectful ( keep in mind, I am emailing back and forth at work ) He calls my cell phone and then emails me threatening to contact my husband 's chain of command and to end the dispute due to me not giving him my husband 's cell phone number. My thing is, you can not insist that I insulted you because I expressed the inconsistencies with this claim which is quite frustrating. Overall, it is not professional to communicate threats in defense of insulted feelings, in the end, we are the customers and XXXX actions were highly unprofessional.

The bank has furthermore not responded about erroneous charges as I emailed the CEO of regions bank, XXXX XXXX at XXXXXXXXXXXX on XXXX XXXX @ XXXX XXXX as time stamped on the email and have not heard back from Regions bank. I understand that banks control currency and therefore think we are their slaves for products such as ( XXXX ) but we are not and as a XXXX I am offended under the United States Constitution that gauranteed my right to freedom of religion, and this must stop or I will need to seek legal civil litigation. The average overdraft fee is about {$30.00} per incident. In addition, many banks charge extended overdraft fees. At Regions it can cost {$210.00} to borrow {$6.00} for six days as a result of the {$35.00} extended overdraft fee. Even worse, nearly 50 % of banks in the country will re-order transactions to increase the number and amount of overdraft fees charged. Rather than debiting money from your checking account in the order that the debits occurred, banks often debit your account in the order that they wished the transactions would have occurred. Because overdrafts are so expensive, the vast majority of people avoid them. In XXXX, an overdraft line of credit is a cash management product that makes sense for everyone. Keeping too much cash is expensive, because it could be better invested or placed into a long-term certificate of deposit. People of all economic backgrounds take advantage of generous overdraft lines of credit, which charge very low interest rates. Borrowing {$6.00} for six days would only cost a few pennies in most large XXXX banks. However, American banks have made going overdraft a sin and high overdraft fees the punishment. As a result, people with money have completely avoided overdrafts. Only a small percentage of the population uses the overdraft product. 8 % of bank customersgenerate 75 % of overdraft fees. Overdrafts have become a short-term borrowing mechanism for people who have no other option. And overdrafts offered by banks are often more expensive than payday lenders. The typical payday lender charges {$15.00} to borrow {$100.00} for XXXX weeks. As I mentioned in the XXXX XXXX XXXX example, large banks are charging much more than that. A banking practice is considered predatory when it meets a few definitions : It targets people with low income or limited financial meansIt charges a price that is dramatically higher than the cost of providing the serviceIt has opaque and complicated pricing that makes it difficult to understand the true cost of the productIt charges the fee when someone is in a vulnerable position and has few alternativesOverdraft fees meet all of those requirements. The price of an overdraft is dramatically higher than the cost of providing the service. Banks charge an average of {$30.00} to decline a transaction, which costs the bank close to nothing. When banks approve a transaction, credit risk is taken. However, the banks are charging effective interest rates above 400 % in the form of fees. The banks are addicted to the revenue, which is why the revenue remains despite the backlash. As overdrafts become more expensive, fewer people will use the service. Banks will extract more revenue from people who have fewer funds and a lower net worth. In my opinion, overdrafts are predatory and action is required. Thank you for your time and attention with this matter and may the peace of XXXX ( through XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX ) which surpasses all understand, be with you, Amen. Respectfully, XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, FL XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX",Company chooses not to provide a public response,REGIONS FINANCIAL CORPORATION,FL,322XX,None,Consent provided,Web,06/29/15,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,No,1442050

The checking account has been open for more than 10 years and the activity on the account has not changed since. The source of the funds have also remained unchanged, the account is funded with regular check deposits from passive rental income. The real property which is the source of the income is located within the US and has been owned by the account holder for 40 years, and it was purchased when the account holder was a permanent US resident, with income generated from employment in the US. The problems started when suspicious calls were made by someone who purported to be from HSBC to the account holder 's residence in XXXX, so we inquired by sending an online banking "" bank mail '' message and HSBC responded that there were no records of HSBC having made calls, so we assumed they were fraudulent calls. Later we received a letter sent to the US mailing address, stating that we needed to call a number to provide missing information before a certain date. No mention of what information was being requested was provided. We made the call in a timely manner but were told by HSBC that we had to provide the unspecified information in person, at a specific HSBC branch, ( which was not near our US address nor was it the branch where the account was opened ). The deadline was not extended regardless that we explained that the account holder resided abroad. The funds were frozen and online banking access blocked. The account holder was able to fly to the US and go the indicated HSBC branch a couple days after the deadline. She brought with us passports, bank statements and proof of the source of the income. We were told by a XXXX XXXX, a Bank manager at the HSBC Branch on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, NY, that "" they '' may not accept the information and documents we were showing her. But she would not tell us who "" they '' were or precisely what information was required. All we knew is that because the account was from a XXXX national, "" they '' needed the source of funds information. We were, however, able to draw an HSBC cashiers check with most of the funds, and decided to take out business elsewhere. We were also told that we could continue using an HSBC credit card which they said had nothing to do with the checking account. Today, notwithstanding, we received a letter informing us that the credit account was being closed because we allegedly failed to provide the information they requested, and online banking is blocked so we can not even pay the balance on the account and will likely incur interests for late payment. We vehemently deny having failed to provide information. We, in fact, provided information regardless of never having been clearly told what information was required or why it was being requested.

Last week was the five-year maturity date, I went to the bank to cash it out and was told that Wells Fargo gave me the wrong product five years ago. I did n't know this at the time, that the product I was given was not the product I asked for. The manager explained that usually when people come in and ask for a CD, it 's because their accountant told them to get a retirement account. Wells Fargo thought that 's what I was asking for. Five years ago, the Wells Fargo banker was n't listening to me and gave me the wrong product? I do n't have enough knowledge to know it was the wrong product. I ask for a {$5000.00} cd at 1/2 % interest for five years and Wells Fargo gives me the paperwork to sign, which I do, not understanding the difference between what I asked for and a retirement CD. This morning a manager from Wells Fargo Branch in XXXX XXXX, CA on XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX. ( where this deal originated ) to let me know that because I signed their paperwork, there is nothing they can do to remedy this situation. So Wells Fargo got my {$5000.00} for five years and I 'm told that not only will I not get the $ XXXX interest I thought I earned, but I will be penalized for taking the money out "" early '' when I turn XXXX years old in XXXX ( have to wait until XXXX or I 'll be penalized even more! ) I will get less than my initial {$5000.00}, because 11 % will be deducted to pay state and federal taxes or fees or whatever you want to call my hard earned money that I get to give away. Wells Fargo benefits from keeping my money for five years without having to pay me anything and the government gets their fees, and I get to pay both of them for my trouble. These too big to fail banks are getting away with too much, they need to be broken up. Why is it that they can launder drug money ( Wells Fargo bought Wachovia ), crash the economy in 2008 by selling loans to people who could n't repay them, take billions in taxpayer money to recoup their losses, pay lobbyists to weaken the new legislation trying to rein them in, and steal money from people like me who have no leverage make them to do what is right and correct their mistakes - with no negative consequences for the banks? I used to work as a XXXX. When my clients were about to sign disclosures and contracts, I sat down with them and reviewed each paragraph to make sure they understood what they were signing, I had a fiduciary responsibility to do so and I took that responsibility very seriously. Wells Fargo should have taken the time to review with me what I was signing to make sure I was getting what I asked for. I hope you can help me. Thank you.

On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, Greentree accepted {$10000.00}. and applied it to the account # that had been discharged in my bankruptcy, also, on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I received a rate modification letter, that spelled out my payments and my interest. At the end of XXXX, I received a form XXXX from Greentree, showing the interest I had paid in XXXX, which was {$11000.00}, that was mortgage interest paid to Greentree. Everything seemed fine, until XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I received a new rate modification letter. That is when Greentrees story began to change. At that time my payment went up, I had to fight with them to honor our agreement and keep the payments the same. They had told me the only reason my XXXX rate modification was for 12 months and not for the length of the loan was because they could only put 12 months at a time in their system. I have the XXXX/XXXX/XXXX rate modification letter to verify that change. I also have the XXXX form XXXX to verify the interest I paid on that loan modification. It was early XXXX that I found out that Greentree never put the home in my name. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I received a letter from Greentree stating that they were currently in the process of deeding the home back into my name. At that time, I was confident everything would be taken care of. Next, I received a letter and was told I was n't paying on a mortgage, but actually paying rent. I threatened to sue them for fraud, if they did n't resolve this. So I retained an attorney, who advised me that taking on a fraud case could be quite expensive, and asked if I really wanted to keep the home, qualifying for a new mortgage would be easier.. That is what we decided upon, and Greentree agreed . The agreement was that if we did n't close the house within 6 months, we would give up possession of the house. At that time, we thought that was a fair deal, because Greentree accepted to sell the house to us at market value. When it came down to final approval, all Greentree had to do was verify the money I had paid them for the previous couple years ... .and state on a legal document that I was either a homeowner or a renter, and they would not sign that form, so my time ran out and they evicted us and took our home XXXX XXXX. We have documentation of everything stated. That was one of the most devastating and emotional events that we have experienced ... .having to leave our home, our friends our church and try to explain why. All because Greentree ran this scam ... ..all they had to do back in XXXX was say no, and they could 've taken the house then.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,Ditech Financial LLC,MH,None,Older American,Consent provided,Web,03/30/16,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,1853924

A little while later I went to a branch of my bank and they began the process of switching me to a new checking account number. Because of the conversation and a few other past issues with the bank, I decided to close my checking account and find a new bank. I visited the Wells Fargo website for information about closing accounts and was told it needed to have a zero balance in order to process. I transferred the remaining funds in the checking account to my Wells Fargo savings account and went to a different branch, XXXX closer to my office. There, a very nice banker told me he could close my savings account ( the XXXX with the transferred checking funds ) but had to wait a day to close the checking account because of pending transactions. He showed me where my checkings account had a zero balance, with the XXXX pending transactions included. We closed savings and I called the next morning to the Wells Fargo customer service line to close checking ( because the website says that 's possible ). Instead, I was told those XXXX pending items had n't cleared - even though all XXXX were conducted by noon the previous day and the bank 's policy is to post transactions made by XXXX on a business day by XXXX. XXXX of the transactions were with the bank, including removing a small amount of cash and moving some checking funds to my linked XXXX credit card. I was told the process could be finished by XXXX meaning I could call after lunch and close the final account. But I checked the account after lunch to confirm the pending items were posted so I could close the account and an overdraft charge was added to the checking account for transferring all the funds out to my savings. I spoke with a customer service representative who said he could do nothing because the overdraft charge was justified, even though my account was zeroed out in order to close it the day before and nothing else posted. I went to the branch that helped me the day before and the banker that helped me was the XXXX to assist me again. He called his supervisor over and told him my account was rightfully at {$0.00} the day before. The supervisor looked at my account and agreed it was n't right. He tried to remove the overdraft charge, but the systems were n't working and told me I would have to go to another branch the next day to make sure it was removed and my balance was back at {$0.00}. Those XXXX pending transactions were all made well before the cutoff the day before, but the customer service representative said she ca n't close a XXXXbalance account with the pending accounts ( including the XXXX done with the bank ). But the transfer of checking funds to my savings account, which was done at XXXX., was posted - not pending, and I find that suspect. Now I 'm having to go to the bank again - on a weekend - to see if they processed the overdraft refund and if my pending transactions are finally posted, a full day after they were supposed to be. I have not done anything with my account as far as spending or transferring funds other than those transactions, yet by not posting them in a timely manner, I 'm being held hostage with this account and incurring fees that are not justified. The bank has not followed it 's own policy for posting transactions to customer accounts, they are levying bogus charges and then their own staff members are admitting it 's not correct.

At that time the agent informed me that he had to do an account review with me and asked me to verify my beneficiary. I told him who it should be ( I actually named my wife and children not remembering I only set up my wife ) and he informed me that a different person was listed. The name he provided was someone who I did not know nor did I ever list them as my beneficiary. I informed him of this and was transferred to another associate to help me set up my beneficiary ( which I already had upon account set up ). After talking with the new assoicate I was told my account was now enabled to view the Beneficiary information online and he would email me the beneificary form. I said that was fine but now I was very concerned that my account was hacked or how this new person got listed as my beneficiary. After further pushing on my part he said it would be researched and I would be called back. After a few minutes someone called me back and said that someone else 's beneficiary was placed on my account by accident. The account number was similar to mine and was keyed in incorrectly. I told this associate that this was not acceptable and that I needed to speak with a Supervisor or Manager.

If I were to pass away they would have received the funds that I put aside for my family 's protection. After the conversations I have the following concerns : 1 ) How is Merrill Lynch sure this has not happened on other customer accounts? 2 ) Why is n't the ability to view my beneficiary info a base option in their website and why do I have to request special access to see it? 3 ) What is Merrill Lynch doing to ensure this does not happen again to me next week if this same customer mails in another update. 4 ) In a day of rampant account fraud why did I have to push the call center agents for this to be investigated when it was learned an error occurred? I was deeply concerned with the casual nature this error was addressed. It may be a drop in the bucket for Merrill Lynch, but for me it is my family 's future.

I knew that meant they would not do it and my suspicion was confirmed when I received a letter from them saying that because of my credit they could not do what I am asking. This is nonsense since I am not a new customer and I ALREADY have an account with them. All they have to do is as I have outlined herein and avoid the potential and highly likely fraud from happening. This has NOTHING to do with my credit. I already have an account with them and all I want is an identical account, but with a new account number, so the crooks can not steal the little money I have that I need to survive ( eat and pay bills and sometimes not even able to do that ).

Wells had arbitrarily switched my accounts to fee bearing, changing the type to way-to-save accounts. The bank claims it had the right to do this when it did not. The bank had a fiduciary responsibility to me as a customer not to change the existing banking agreement. Does Wells not know what grandfathered means? Secondly, Wells falsely advertises that "" it provides services that customers want and need ''. I never wanted nor needed Wells ' bait and switch of my accounts.

7/7/15,Bank account or service,Other bank product/service,"Account opening, closing, or management",None,"This is the XXXX complaint that I have filed against Capital One Bank during the last 57 days. For information regarding my initial complaint, which also involved my Rewards Money Market account ( hereafter, RMMA ), please see Case XXXX ( hereafter, Case XXXX ). A brief summary of the facts associated with Case XXXX will facilitate CFPB 's understanding of my current complaint:1 ) After making a {$230000.00} deposit to my RMMA in XX/XX/XXXX, I had, as of XX/XX/XXXX, not received reward points for the month of XXXX. Historically, Capital One Bank credited reward points to my RMMA within the XXXX five days of the new month. 2 ) When I contacted Capital One, they cited a "" bank wide system issue '' as the reason for the delay in reward points posting to my account, a claim reiterated in a letter, dated XX/XX/XXXX, that I received after this issue was resolved. 3 ) This letter also stated that the computer issue lasted from XXXX XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX. Note that Case XXXX was actually filed two days after ( XXXX XXXX ) the computer issue that effected RMMAs was resolved. Yet reward points were not posted to my account until ~ XXXX XXXX and Capital One backdated this posting to XX/XX/XXXX. 4 ) Finally, I know another individual who has a RMMA and he/she received his/her reward points during the XXXX five days of XXXX ( Note XXXX, below ). This fact appears to be inconsistent with a "" bank wide system issue '' - if the issue was "" system wide, '' presumably all RMMA accounts were effected, right? Onto my current submission:1 ) On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an unsigned, undated notice from Capital One Bank informing me that my RMMA was being closed. 2 ) The notice did n't quite put it that way : instead, it stated that my ability to earn rewards points in my RMMA would end on XX/XX/XXXX and that the funds in the RMMA would be swept into a High Yield money market account in XX/XX/XXXX. 3 ) I received this notice 53 days after Case XXXX was opened. Retaliation for contacting the CFPB? 4 ) This notice arrived after a period ( XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX ) in which I had redeemed a high number ( Note XXXX, below ) of rewards points ( XXXX ). Possibly, Capital One 's attitude towards RMMA holders is, "" Please, send us your money, because if you do then you 'll earn reward points (! ) but if you actually use a lot of these points in a short period of time, well, that will make us sad and we will close your account in order to foreclose the possibility of future sadness. "" In terms of outcomes, I would prefer to leave my funds in my RMMA and continue to earn rewards points. Hence, I have XXXX questions for Capital One : 1 ) Are all RMMAs like the one I hold being closed on XX/XX/XXXX? 2 ) If not, then why, exactly, is my RMMA being closed? Note 1 - I omitted this information from Case XXXX because I had not received permission from my friend to include it in that filing. Understand that my friend 's points posted the XXXX five days of XXXX - they appeared in his/her account during this period. In contrast, my points did not post until ~ XXXX XXXX and were backdated to XX/XX/XXXX by Capital One. Note 2 - By "" high, '' I mean relative to my perception of my annual spending on my Capital One Visa, which runs around {$16000.00}. A brief explanation is required : the rewards points referenced above are earned in a money market account offered by Capital One Bank. I typically transfer these points to my Capital One Visa rewards account, where I use them to offset travel ( airline tickets, hotel ) purchases.",None,CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION,NY,115XX,None,Consent provided,Web,7/8/15,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,Yes,1454101

I had no access via deposit slips or through my ATM debit card to this savings account so therefore was unable to make deposits to the savings account I did not know I had. 6 : the mobile app would not work for me once I got the new checking account so I deleted it. Web banking was seemingly constantly undergoing updates and changes so it was very hard to access my account on line. 7 : THIS IS ABSOLUTELY INSANE! Today I recieved a letter from suntrust stating that my checking account had been closed and charged off with a negative balance. This letter, dated XXXX XXXX, actually is referring to the checking account I CLOSED IN XXXX! When the account was closed it was in good standing. I never recieved any calls or mail from the bank regarding this until today. So I am now lead to believe the account was in fact never fully closed and some sort of inner bank activity was happening with it against my stated wishes and knowledge. How is this legal or even possible?? When I was at the bank on Friday, as well as the phone call with the very rude young man, I was told by both of them that they could see the old account and the date it had been closed by me with the help of a "" manager '' at the branch. Yet, I recieve a letter on XX/XX/XXXX that Suntrust closed the account and is now demanding {$100.00} in fees. This shows a very sneaky and dishonest business model and perhaps even theft, not to mention extremely poor customer service regarding not just XXXX but XXXX accounts, leaving me with having to clean up the mess with not just Suntrust but also the businesses I use that deduct money, in good faith, from my account. My credit rating may be negatively affected, as well as relationships with my creditors and service providers. I believed yesterday I was finished with this stressful and costly experience.

02/21/17,Bank account or service,Checking account,"Account opening, closing, or management",None,"Dear CFPB Officials and Financial Service Providers : I am prompted to write this complaint because, through no fault of my own, I have been effectively barred from the financial industry - and the costs of being un-banked are simply enormous. Even though I continue to earn money I am paid via U.S. checks and despite trying every bank that I could reach - none of them would cash the check without me first opening a checking account. And although I have tried opening a checking account at more than XXXX separate US banks - I continued to be denied access to even the most basic checking or savings account. Generally speaking, these banks do not tell me why I am denied, just that they have made a business decision to not offer their services to me ( although I continue to receive targeted advertising offers in the mail, through email, etc. ) I have lived for a while now paying excessive fees to have my checks cashed via special check cashing businesses but the fees are outrageous and the time spent waiting for a check to clear is often in excess of 10 days. I am very much at my wits end because I am not sure what else to do. I have tried repairing my credit but due to an unresolved identity theft event that occurred in 2013 - I am having difficulty doing so. I have even gone through all the steps to correct my credit report but the various financial institutions will not remove the false information despite multiple police reports, affidavits, etc. Additionally, twice I have gone through the lengthy process of applying for a new Social Security Number and twice the Social Security Administration lost my paperwork. Without rambling on forever, I am attempting to resolve this situation by granting my Mother durable power of attorney rights in hopes that she will be able to sign and cash the checks I have received as well as provide basic banking services for me. In addition to the costs associated with paying check cashing processors, without a bank account I pay more for everything and am even denied by entire business sectors. For example, despite searching for months I have yet to find a health insurance provided that allows payment via cash, I am unable to take advantage of the savings associated with purchasing things online, I am barred from consumer services such as XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, etc - because I can not input a credit or debit card number, and I would say generally being without a checking account almost doubles the cost of living through increased prices, limited consumer services, and significant delays associated with cashing checks. In light of this, I would ask that Wells Fargo & Company honor the attached durable power of attorney. My mother and I have previously attempted cooperate with our local bank on how to resolve this situation but the necessary documents and instructions required of us are vague and keep on changing. Thus I am writing this complaint in hopes to spur a resolution that would provide remediation the problems associated with being un-banked. Further, I wish for the bank to investigate whether the decision to deny me access to basic banking services has to do with the fact that I have reported fraud to the SEC, CFPB, and OCC concerning illicit account opening practices and BSA compliance failures.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,CA,959XX,None,Consent provided,Web,02/21/17,Closed with explanation,No,No,2354792

I specifically opened an account that did not have a minimum balance requirement, as I was in college and did not have any money to spare. I only worked at this job for about a year and then closed the checking account, as I did not work there any longer. I have since moved to the XXXX area in XX/XX/XXXX and have never heard a thing from U.S. Bank since closing my checking account 8 years ago. I 'm in the process of purchasing a home and my mortgage lender told me there was a delinquency on a US Bank account that I needed to take care of, as I had n't paid my bill in over 6 months and it was taking a huge toll on my credit score. I had absolutely no idea what she was talking about, as I did not have a US Bank card to my knowledge. After numerous, numerous phone calls, we came to the conclusion that this checking account was never appropriately closed. US Bank decided to apply a new policy requiring a minimum balance to this checking account of mine that has n't been used in over 8 years and was still open, not to my knowledge. There was less than {$1.00} in the account apparently, and they decided to start charging my account $ XXXX without my knowledge. I did not receive XXXX phone call, email, letter in the mail, about this. I received nothing. They were tacking on late fees and not notifying me either. Again, after more phone calls, I found out that they have documentation stating all of the letters they sent out notifying me of the late fees were being sent back to them, as they did not have the correct address. They were sending it to an address that I have n't lived in in over 7 years. I have moved numerous times throughout the past years, but every time I move, I update the post office to forward my mail for a year. I did not update US Bank on my address changes, because I was unaware that the account was not closed. US Bank claims they attempted to call me XXXX about this. They had XXXX phone numbers on file. XXXX was my cell phone number, which has not changed in 15 years. The other was an old work number, from when I worked at XXXX hospital. They obviously did not get ahold of me on the old work phone, as again, I have n't worked there in 8 years. They never once called my cell phone. My primary phone number now, and primary phone number over the past 15 years. They never called. I attempted to speak with numerous supervisors and also the branch manager at XXXX hospital in which no one is willing to admit this is a bank error. I do not feel anyone appropriately followed up with me. No one called my cell phone and no one sent any mail to my primary residence, in which I own the home and have owned for over 5 years. I was willing to pay the fee, which is now {$170.00} if they removed the late fees from my credit report, as this issue has dropped my score over XXXX points! This could be a reason that I may not be able to get a home. I do not pay bills late, ever, and did not want this any more late than it already is, so I paid the {$170.00} to US Bank and they still did not compromise with me at all.

In fact, the issuance date for the card was, as I recall, one day after my passport indicates I crossed the border, making it an absolute impossibility to possess such a card. On the return trip part of the time coming home I had an American rider I picked up from whom I was able to get enough money to pay for fuel.

I did n't believe it for one minute and now I know why. Wells Fargo continued to harass me for months afterward, how many months I can not recall. I finally had enough and called them, explained it all as I have to you, and assured them in no uncertain terms that they would never receive any payment from me regardless of the nature of threats of collection. I do no recall how many times I spoke to a WF rep, it was a few, and the last time I simply said I would never, ever pay, that I knew they were unable to force payment, and that that would be the last word from me. She simply said, OK, we 'll cancel it. And that was it. Fast forward 4 years : One of the reps at the local branch of WF, in XXXX XXXX, where I still had a checking account, asked me to sit down and proceeded to outline all the benefits of having a savings account. I was cautious and uninterested, but she assured me of the advantages of such, including a free credit report. I essentially said OK, just to obtain the credit report out of curiosity mostly as I do n't care what my credit score is. I never borrow money. Over the next few months I made several withdrawals from that account, and one day I got a letter indicating that I had violated some obscure Federal code or regulation regarding how frequently I could do so. I returned to the bank for an explanation, which was weak at best, and I confronted her with the fact that she had never disclosed to me such limitations. I simply asked her "" Whose money is it? '' She responded "" It 's yours ''.

When I inquired about overdrafts, the personal banker XXXX XXXX was confusing the opt-in and opt-out terminology. He stated that opt-out meant my overdrafts would be paid. He said everyone was opted out automatically and they could change to opt-in and not pay overdrafts. I said, "" Really at XXXX they said opt-in meant paying overdrafts. '' I finally forced him to find me a copy of the account terms and conditions he was making me acknowledge receiving. He had no idea what I was requesting and tried to tell me the signature card page I signed was the Deposit Account Agreement and then tried to say the pricing schedule was it. I was persistent that there were additional account terms he had n't provided and they likely called it a handbook. He ran to a different area of the branch to look for one. Why are n't the account opening disclosures available at the desk where they make you open an account? Why does n't the personal banker know what the account agreement is? Finally, when he came back with the booklet ( Deposit Account Agreement ), I quickly flipped to the overdraft section and showed him the page on overdrafts. I read him the line that said opt-in meant paying my overdrafts and I wanted to be opted in. He said, "" Oh, I was confusing the terms, but I can easily check a box to change that. '' I said, "" I do n't have to do anything else? '' and he said, "" no. '' I did not receive a separate notice describing the overdraft practice or a confirmation of opt-in. I called the XXXX number to inquire about my opt-in status on XXXX/XXXX/15 since I did n't receive an overdraft confirmation or notice. She confirmed I was opted in. She said most people opt-in online. She could n't explain why I did n't get the disclosures but put me on hold to talk to XXXX at the branch. When the person came back she said XXXX would mail the overdraft disclosures to me. XXXX mailed me the handbook and privacy policy but no overdraft disclosure or confirmation. I went to close my account on XXXX/XXXX/15 the Service Manager XXXX XXXX told me that I would be charged a fee if I closed my account, but I could talk to a banker to see about waiving the fee. I explained I was closing my account because they were n't complying with the regulations. The supervisor did n't care to ask what the violation was and he refused to let me withdraw the {$100.00} that was in my account. I was forced to go talk to the same banker who does n't understand overdrafts to get the account closing fee waived and then go back to the teller line to wait for a cashier 's check. I deposited cash and asked for cash to be returned to me, why was I forced to get a cashier 's check. It is hugely surprising that a supervisor is unable to waive a fee or did n't care about the details of a regulatory violation. I think this is a problem that has impacted several other customers. The personal banker does n't give out the deposit account agreement unless a person is forceful like I was. He tried to tell me the XXXX page "" Individual Signature Card '' was the agreement. Even after I read the sentence about acknowledging receipt of the Handbook, he was unsure for what I was looking. Neither the personal banker nor the call center agent and XXXX understand what the required process is to comply with the Regulation E overdraft regulations.

02/25/17,Bank account or service,Other bank product/service,"Account opening, closing, or management",None,"Dear Sirs ; Madame, I would like to file a complaint against TDBank, N.A. for falsifying my credit card account summary. Today I am greeting you with sincerity and calm. I am a long time customer of The TDBank N.A., system. I am not a big saver, barely on the fringes and particularly at this time. Recently I inquired into my credit account which is displayed with my checking account, on the same page. It is convenient and innovative to put both account summaries on the same page so I can read what is going on simultaneously. I 've always abided by what I was reading. One day while trying to use my credit card, I was declined. I could n't understand why, since I make payments by the auto payments system connected to the accounts. It occurred to me that I am constantly being charged a late fee. It also occurred to me that I am always showing a zero balance due every month. I was always assuming the auto payment system had already deducted the amount posted. I was wrong, since one day when I tried to use my credit I found that I had barely paid the amount owed that month. I was alittle confused but paid the amount requested, {$2.00}. How could I have not known that I was underpaying on my credit account when the statement summary always showed XXXX balance due? Then one day I called. Here is how the conversation went. Hello, my name is XXXX, account # XXXX. I am on the TDBank website right now looking at my accounts, checking and credit. Could you tell me why I am looking at a zero balance due on my credit card statement when I know it is due, and while I am paying two auto payments twice monthly in the amount of {$35.00}, yet according to you I need to pay {$82.00} this month? Sure, Customer Service said, here is what is going on. Your account is not showing the true accurate amount. What? I said. I am looking at the page right now, how is it not showing me the true accurate amount owed?. Well, Customer Service said, what you are looking at, and I quote, is an assumption of what you owe. If you want to know what you actually owe and what your true account statement reads you need to log onto, and with that she proceeds to provide me a whole other website with a whole other registration. So, you mean to tell me that for all these years I 've had this account, this has not been showing me the accurate truth of my statements? Yes, she said. You will need to log onto the the website I provided. I do not know how much money I 've paid in late fees because I am going by what TDBank, N.A. provides as a viable true summary of my accounts and statements. I can not afford to pay a late fee, I can not afford to pay more when I was under the assumption I was paying the amount required. I would like you to go back into my credit account, look back at how long I have been paying late fees, and put back into my checking account the money that I paid in late fees while reading an inaccurate balance due because of your falsified summary of statements. Sincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX",None,TD BANK US HOLDING COMPANY,ME,041XX,None,Consent provided,Web,3/1/17,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,No,2361136

I received a phone call from a representative from NFCU, XXXX XXXX on Tuesday, XX/XX/2017 @ XXXX. He left a voicemail to which I immediately called him back and we subsequently spoke for 35 minutes concerning my issues with his institution. He stated that he would either be calling me back later that afternoon or at the very latest the following morning, Wednesday XX/XX/XXXX to discuss his findings and the next steps accordingly. At this juncture, I have yet to hear back from him or anyone else re [ resenting this institution. I am extremely concerned that this account is now 54 days past due and I am in desperate need to try and resolve this before the 60 day mark. This means that I now only have 5 more days to rectify this situation or else NFCU will report a 60 day late to the ( XXXX ) credit bureaus ; XXXX, XXXX and XXXX. As noted in my previous claim and the conversation I had with XXXX XXXX, NFCU has already reported a 30 day and I fear extreme penalties with not only NFCU but additionally my other creditors accordingly. This is simply yet another example of how not one single person re [ resenting NFCU has carried out what they stated they would do.

I would appreciate someone calling me back today regarding both of the cases so that me and my family along with NFCU can hope to take the next steps so that we can all go back to some form of normalcy defined as no delinquent payments and 100 % visibility within my accounts.

I asked them why they paid the debit instead of returning it. PNC 's response was that they base it off of customer history. They acted like they did me a favor by paying the debit. At that point, I tried to get them to act proactively instead of retroactively. I explained that fees would still be adding into my account, and that it was n't fair because PNC should have never paid a transaction that the funds were not available for. The gentleman told me that the fees would have to be dealt with after they were incurred. I, as the consumer, do not have time to worry about whether or not PNC will refund these fees. I feel as if PNC is aware of the hardships they are causing their customers just based off of the complaints I have read in this database. They are charging fees that are unfair, and not allowing me time to fix the negative balance without charging me more money. In reality, they are causing a lot of trouble. Because the account has been negative for more than 4 calendar days, they are charging me a {$7.00} daily negative balance fee for up to 15 days ( totaling as much as {$100.00} ). By the time I am able to bring this balance positive, I will have incurred more in fees that the original debit. And because my account will have had a negative balance for fourteen days, it is a risk that it will go into a closing state. If that happens, then it will go on record that I owe PNC money, and I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO HAVE ANOTHER CHECKING ACCOUNT BECAUSE OF THE BAD MARK ON MY BANKING HISTORY. I have never owed money to a bank, nor have I put myself into that position.

I called citi again and asked why they never sent me the debit card and initiated the deposit, and the representative told me it was their mistakes. I asked her if I was still qualified for the XXXX dollars promotion and she said I did because it was their mistake, she also promised me that she will put a note under my account saying that it was their mistake that made me miss the XXXX month deadline and I was still qualified for the promotion. So I asked her if she needed the bank information to transfer the money out into Citi and she said she had all the information she needed and there is no need for me to provide anything else.

However, Wells Fargo held me responsible, rather than their employees for cashing and my account was debited in those amounts {$1100.00} and {$2300.00} - Which, I must add had been reported as fraud to several agencies. Fast forward to XX/XX/XXXX I am a struggling graduate student trying to pay for coursework, and my sister sent me a check for {$1000.00} to help.

The teller confirmed that the account would be closed and handed me in cash the remaining balance. I also have a credit card account with Wells Fargo and it was setup to autopay from my checking account. Payment was due on XXXX/XXXX/15 in the amount of {$290.00}. I attempted to cancel that autopay but they do n't allow you to do it online. Since the checking account had been closed, I decided to not worry about it since could n't very well autopay from a closed account. I made payments of {$500.00} & {$1000.00} to the credit card account on XXXX/XXXX/15 from XXXX separate checking accounts outside of Wells Fargo. Both posted on XXXX/XXXX/15. Wells Fargo proceeded to deduct {$290.00} from my closed checking account and transfer it as a payment to the credit card account. This caused the checking account to be charged a {$35.00} insufficient funds fee. I specifically opted out of their overdraft system previously and chose to instead have them deny payment if insufficient funds due to their manipulation of their internal system to generate fees. They then transferred {$290.00} from my credit card account ( yes, the same XXXX they had just paid ) to cover the overdraft in the checking account and charged that account another {$35.00} for paying the overdraft. Another option that I had specifically exercised to not implement because of the outrageous fee they were going to charge for as little as covering a {$1.00} overdraft. They set the system up so they would make {$70.00} for any possible overdraft if you let them tie it to your credit card account. After speaking with the Wells Fargo claims department after sending them an email detailing the problem, I was informed by the claims department person that I needed to take this up with the local branch because she did n't show the account closed. So far, I 'm about an hour into trying to protect my money and still have to spend time at my local branch. I would n't file this complaint at this point except I doubt I 'm unique in this situation and I suspect that Wells Fargo has generated a great deal to their bottom line by manipulating accounts and fees and most people just give up rather than fight them. Of course, that 's exactly why your agency was created and hopefully you will be able to force them to quit these heinous practices.

In 2013, U.S Bank opened a reserve line on my behalf, at the suggestion of a personal banker. It was pitched to me as overdraft protection. The problem is that the instrument was not properly explained to me over the phone and thus I was unaware that in the event of a negative checking balance, the reserve line would be drawn upon, rather than simply dipping into my savings. The banker did not tell me this crucial fact. Over the course of 3 years, I received a number of unnecessary and extreme interest charges totaling around {$800.00}. I believe the following : 1 ) This instrument was "" sold '' to me improperly 2 ) It was not properly explained by the banker ( the process to authorize by phone and there is no paper trail to show that I understood the penalties or how the instrument worked ) 3 ) It amounts to fee gouging and does not alert consumers clearly that they are drawing on this expensive line ( had I known this, I could have simply replenished my checking account ) I 've been on the phone for multiple hours with low level online banking support and through a branch. They tried to be helpful but did n't have the authority to move this along. I am diligent in my review of my monthly statements but they are not laid out in a transparent manner and this reserve line was buried on page XXXX.

A Bank of America Merchant Services ( BAMA ) representative confirmed this for me. He also knew that I would not be processing a high volume of card transactions, but he guaranteed that banking would be free ( Lie # 2 ). I spoke with him on the phone and he sent over paperwork to lease card processing equipment through XXXX XXXX. The contracts were extremely long. I told him I only wanted a 3 year contract.

The BAMA rep ( XXXX. ) sent in paperwork for a 4 year lease and I signed it because I trusted him.

I called and BoA waived the fees a few times acknowledging that I processed cards through them. But more fees came each month that I failed to have a card sale.

04/29/16,Bank account or service,Other bank product/service,"Account opening, closing, or management",None,"In my law practice, I serve as a trustee for a client ( who also happens to be my brother-in-law ). The sole purpose of the trust account, and the trust account above, is to provide funding for a life insurance policy. The life insurance policy is mandated by my client's/brother-in-law 's divorce decree in the State of New York. Relatively recently, my brother-in-law 's obligation to maintain the life insurance policy expired. At the time, there remained slightly less than {$200.00} in the trust bank account at Citibank. As mentioned above, this bank account was exclusively for the purpose of funding the aforementioned life insurance policy. Because it was no longer necessary to fund the life insurance policy, and my brother-in-law decided to allow the policy to lapse, I sought to close the account and return the remaining funds within the account to my brother-in-law. To that end, I called Citibank. I spoke with a woman who assured me that she would close the account and send a check made payable to the trust, so that I might return that money to my client/brother-in-law. Approximately one month later, I received a statement from Citibank indicating that the account was still open, and that approximately {$12.00} had been deducted as fees on the account. Needless to say, I was surprised. After all, I had closed the account and was expecting to receive a check, not a statement deducting more fees. Consequently, I wrote to Citibank.

After speaking to them for a few minutes she came back to us and said that there must have been a mistake and were we sure that we had not had the other spouses name removed from the account.

Even though I continue to earn money I am paid via U.S. checks and despite trying every bank that I could reach - none of them would cash the check without me first opening a checking account. And although I have tried opening a checking account at more than XXXX separate US banks - I continued to be denied access to even the most basic checking or savings account. Generally speaking, these banks do not tell me why I am denied, just that they have made a business decision to not offer their services to me ( although I continue to receive targeted advertising offers in the mail, through email, etc. ) I have lived for a while now paying excessive fees to have my checks cashed via special check cashing businesses but the fees are outrageous and the time spent waiting for a check to clear is often in excess of 10 days. I am very much at my wits end because I am not sure what else to do. I have tried repairing my credit but due to an unresolved identity theft event that occurred in 2013 - I am having difficulty doing so. I have even gone through all the steps to correct my credit report but the various financial institutions will not remove the false information despite multiple police reports, affidavits, etc. Additionally, twice I have gone through the lengthy process of applying for a new Social Security Number and twice the Social Security Administration lost my paperwork. Without rambling on forever, I am attempting to resolve this situation by granting my Mother durable power of attorney rights in hopes that she will be able to sign and cash the checks I have received as well as provide basic banking services for me. In addition to the costs associated with paying check cashing processors, without a bank account I pay more for everything and am even denied by entire business sectors. For example, despite searching for months I have yet to find a health insurance provided that allows payment via cash, I am unable to take advantage of the savings associated with purchasing things online, I am barred from consumer services such as XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, etc - because I can not input a credit or debit card number, and I would say generally being without a checking account almost doubles the cost of living through increased prices, limited consumer services, and significant delays associated with cashing checks. In light of this, I would ask that US Bank honor the attached durable power of attorney. My mother and I have previously attempted cooperate with our local bank on how to resolve this situation but the necessary documents and instructions required of us are vague and keep on changing. Thus I am writing this complaint in hopes to spur a resolution that would provide remediation the problems associated with being un-banked. Further, I wish for the bank to investigate whether the decision to deny me access to basic banking services has to do with the fact that I have reported fraud to the SEC, CFPB, and OCC concerning illicit account opening practices and BSA compliance failures.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,U.S. BANCORP,CA,959XX,None,Consent provided,Web,02/21/17,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2354067

After numerous hours of face to face discussions and hours of phone transfers, I ended up speaking with XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). She told me that I needed to fax her proof that Wells Fargo had done an inquiry from all XXXX bureaus and that it had been a mortgage inquiry to XXXX At my own expense, I obtained my credit reports.

So I went to them she told me that she would investigate it and she did and told me that they were closing my account with no answer as to want happened because she gave my the {$300.00} and something dollars that I had left available on my account.

So I called them up and told them that I was going to resolve the balance because I did not want any problems with them being reported to any collection agencies. This representative assured me that as long as I paid that everything would be okay and I could open up another bank account anywhere else because they were not going to report me. I asked her about timeframes and she told me that as long as I kept open lines of communication with them I would be okay since this was not my fault.

2/3/16,Bank account or service,Checking account,"Account opening, closing, or management",None,"On XXXX XXXX, 2015 I used my Wells Fargo ATM card to withdraw {$200.00}. Instead of issuing me the money, the ATM shut down, but did deduct {$200.00} from my checking account. That day, I filed a complaint via WF customer service ( telephone ). I was told my complaint would be settled in 3 days. After 3 days I called and was told it would take 10 days.

She basically accused me of trying to defraud Wells Fargo and when I asked if she considered me a criminal, she was silent. She was so abusive that I expected the police to ring my doorbell any day and arrest me! The Wells Fargo ATM Manager is an exceedingly rude, belligerent bully. Because of her -- after being a customer for 35 years! -- I decided to close my Checking Account and went to my local branch at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX where I spoke to Service Manager XXXX XXXX. This was on XXXX XXXX, 2015. XXXX XXXX told me that because WF has issued me a "" temporary credit '' of {$200.00} while it investigated my ATM claim, I could not close my account. On XXXX XXXX I wrote WF CEO XXXX XXXX a letter explaining what happened and telling him that WF was holding my checking account hostage ( not allowing me to close it ) and I offered to let him keep the disputed {$200.00} -- just let me close my account!!! He did not respond. Around XXXX XXXX, I received a letter from WF saying the company was still researching my complaint.

Two weeks later, after confirming that they received my signature card which validates the account, I attempted to use the mobile checking app to deposit XXXX checks of {$1000.00} each for a total of {$3000.00}. These checks were my own checks from a different bank. Essentially, I wrote XXXX checks to myself from Bank XXXX in order to transfer the money to my SunTrust account. Two days after this, when I tried logging into my SunTrust account to make sure that the checks had cleared, I was denied access to my account. I waited a few more days and upon realizing that I was still unable to access my account, I called SunTrust to resolve this problem. I was informed that the account was placed on hold because it may have violated a SunTrust regulation and instructed to wait for a letter in the mail. I finally received this letter to which the representative on the phone was referring on XXXX XXXX. The reason for the hold was as follows : "" Reason XXXX XXXX : Deposit exceeds client 's average balance. '' This explanation is completely illogical. Naturally, any new account will run into this problem! My average balance was less than {$100.00} -- the initial deposit I made with the bank representative when opening the account. I had tried to deposit {$3000.00}, a normal amount of money to begin using the account and SunTrust responds by putting my account on hold. It does not even make sense for such a modest sum of money to even be flagged considering that the account MINIMUM was {$25000.00}. The amount I deposited was barely a fraction of that. When I received this letter, I still held out hope that once the checks cleared then SunTrust would be reassured that everything is normal and they would lift the hold. NOT THE CASE. I received a letter on XXXX XXXX that SunTrust decided to close the account. On XXXX XXXX, I received another letter that clarified that SunTrust reserves the right to close any account for any reason and without disclosing the reason. To make matters worse, I only received a check for {$90.00}. I checked with Bank XXXX and they confirmed that the {$3000.00} in checks had cleared. I called SunTrust and they said they will not return the {$3000.00} until XXXX.

I paid on this account to avoid any disparaging credit notifications to the credit bureaus. I told him twice to send the information and to date have not received anything!

I said no and they gave me the number to call and I promptly called to report the issue - they said no problem in closing the account and investigating. I ca n't even remember the name of the bank I called affiliated with this account at this time.

I pay my bills when received and this is what I did with this company - not knowing it is crazy. 7.

This account for us was a dormant account since we only planned to use it in the case of a medical emergency. Wells Fargo agreed to the same fees and terms of our agreement with Wachovia which were that we suppose to maintain a minimum balance of {$1000.00}, which later changed to {$1500.00} but since we had more money there than that, we continue with the account. We transferred a large IRA Account and small IRA 's CD, and without our consent, they put us under a new product called Wells Fargo, PMA Package, this product required to have a minimum balance combined with all our accounts of over {$25000.00} of linked FDIC accounts or {$50000.00} on our accounts. We never knew that we were on this PMA Package since they move us to online statements. We were receiving statements for our IRA 's and we thought that we were not receiving statements of our emergency account because the account was dormant. We moved from Wells Fargo most of our IRA 's and left the emergency account there because we used it for our Safety Deposit Box and medical emergency. A year and several months later we learned that they were deducting {$30.00} XXXX every month for not being under the PMA Package, even if the checking account still named Crown Classic. They deducted {$30.00} XXXX every month from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX for a total of {$570.00} XXXX. We trusted them so when I went to the branch to check my wife 's IRA they told me that my account was dormant and that I need to deposit more money which I did a couple of occasions. How can an account be dormant if they are withdrawing money every month?! When we realized about this happening on XX/XX/XXXX we talked to every person at the bank, we asked who authorized the change to a PMA Package account because we did not ; they did not provide us a document signed by us that could prove that. We even spoke with the District manager, she said they sent statements to our house, which was not true. Finally, they accepted their mistake but they said they only could reimburse us for XXXX fees, which they did by stopping the fee for XX/XX/XXXX and reimbursing us {$60.00} XXXX for the month of XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX.

Please pay special attention to the interest summary that shows APYE is 1.35 % which is slightly higher than the 1.34 % as promised. The interest paid in this month is {$160.00}. 3 : The first 6 month expired in XX/XX/XXXX. The interest rate shall drop to 0.75 % after the first 6 months for this account according to the promotion. Instead, PNC bank only gave ~0.12 % APYE. Please see my XX/XX/XXXX monthly statement in the document 3 in the attachment. Please pay special attention to the interest summary 0.12 % APYE and the interest paid in this month is {$22.00} which is less than XXXX of the interest in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX is with much higher balance. I have contacted PNC bank since XX/XX/XXXX and talked to PNC bank retail escalation group several times. They have been postponing the answer until XX/XX/XXXX. I received a voice message. The voice message basically refuses to make the interest rate adjustment and told me the rate referenced in the promotion is yearly average. PNC Bank indicated that the interest 0.74 % APY after 6 months is averaging with the prior 6 months interest rate of 1.35 % so the rate after 6 month is actually 0.12 % APY and no adjustment will be made. The voice message in attached in the document 4. Their explanation is totally unacceptable to me : A : As the rate refers in promotion 1.35 % for the 6 months is APY as shown in my XX/XX/XXXX months statement and the 0.12 % is also APY in the XX/XX/XXXX statement. They are the same APY. The after 6 months promotion rate 0.75 % is also APY and why does not show in my XX/XX/XXXX statement as 0.75 %, rather it showed 012 %? B : The interest paid in the XX/XX/XXXX statement is more than XXXX of my XX/XX/XXXX for one month. The balance of XX/XX/XXXX is much higher than the balance in XXXX. If XXXX interest 1.35 % APY is consistent with the 0.75 % APY after 6 months according to the promotion rate, the interest paid in XX/XX/XXXX shall be much higher. C : I do not believe any bank will refer the APY that is balance with the prior interest rate it offers. For example, instead of 1.35 % APY in the first 6 months, PNC bank can offer 5 % APY in the first 6 months and 0.74 % APY after 6 months to lure customer. If PNC Bank explanation make senses, does it mean consumer have to pay negative interest rate to PNC Bank after 6 months. I believe that PNC bank explanation is deceiving and telling lie to customer. The 0.74 % APY shall refer to the interest rate after 6 months not averaging with the interest rate in the first 6 months. It is also clearly suggested in the note 2 of their promotional offer. The offer stated, the introductory interest rate of 0.74 % does not apply to the first XXXX balance teirs.

12/2/16,Bank account or service,Other bank product/service,"Account opening, closing, or management",None,"Some years ago ( approximately 2010 ) I opened what I considered to be a Line of Credit with variable rate through Citibank. Citibank, according to my monthly statements, terms this as a "" Variable Rate Equity Source Account ''. Total amount that I requested was for {$140000.00} of which I used {$100000.00} or so. What I do not understand is that no matter that the interest rate varies, and I have made two payments totaling {$2000.00} strictly towards principal my principal balance hardly decreases. Even when I paid down the principal the bank still went ahead and based their following month 's interest accrual on the total prior to the principal payment. The interest rate never varies in total ; each month at least for this year it is averaging at 5.30 %. So my total monthly payment which includes principal and interest never changes much from approximately {$450.00} give or take a few dollars. I have gone into the bank to ask why this is, and the rep. told me that while the interest rate is variable it 's still based on prime + spread. I find this to be very deceiving as I do not understand why I have to be charged extra ( spread ). It is exceedingly difficult for me to understand if I entered into a contract understanding that I will be charged a variable rate that I am in reality paying what amounts to be a fixed rate. Again as I mentioned above my average monthly statement is for {$450.00} give or take a few dollars. This is not right in my opinion. Also I have to complain about Citibank 's procedure for paying down on my principal. I feel they make it very difficult for a customer to do so as I was told that I needed to mail a check stating it 's for principal with the excuse that only the particular department it goes to can handle the transaction. I was told that it was impossible to even make an online payment towards principal. I can not understand why in the internet age this is not possible ... or to have a bank clerk process the transaction! What I feel is Citibank knows a snail mailed check will most likely not reach them in time for the principal balance to be decreased thereby allowing them legal right to charge interest based on a higher principal balance.

XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX. 4. Best Buy Credit Services, XXXX. XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX. The information is inaccurate because I never have filed for Bankruptcy, there is no indication of bankruptcy in my credit history and there is no court documentation or file number to refer a case of bankruptcy on my behalf. I have attempted time and time again to clear this matter up with Citi Corp Credit Services. I am treated like I committed a crime, their personnel is rude and only focus on collection money for credit accounts that have always been paid on time. The XXXX as well as the Macy 's accounts are paid in full. I am lied to over and over again with statements such as we are looking into the matter and no resolution ever takes place. I have been stoned wall since XX/XX/2016. The Shell credit card was reinstated only to be deactivated on XX/XX/2016. The worst part is that I am a XXXX so they are not only destroying my good credit and reputation but my career and in turn my life. I have filed disputes with the credit bureaus, reviewed my credit reports on-line and requested a copy of my credit reports. As you know it will take time to receive my credit reports. I have no way of defending myself. As a 15 years XXXX veteran and someone who continues to work to XXXX, I find it very scary that my life can be turned upside down in this manner. Clearly this is a mistake on the part of Citibank Citi Corp Credit Services yet I can not get anyone to correct this mistake and I have been trying to solve this issue since XX/XX/2016 only to be treated as if my life does not matter. In this country a criminal is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty, yet I am assumed to be guilty of bankruptcy with no indication of bankruptcy in my credit history and there is no court documentation or file number to refer a case of bankruptcy on my behalf. Please investigate this matter so this issue can be corrected and I can move on with my life.

03/21/16,Bank account or service,Other bank product/service,"Account opening, closing, or management",None,"I paid off XXXX of my credit card accounts with Bank of America XX/XX/XXXX. Recently, I began using XXXX of those accounts again. I received an email notice of an amount due ( of {$20.00} ) on the closed account and tried to access that account online to determine the validity of the charge and pay if owed. I was blocked from accessing the account by Bank of America. I called and for almost 2 months tried to get resolution on the problem they created. I finally relinquished and send them the {$20.00} payment, to which they assigned a {$1.00} late payment assessment. After two more months and several calls and internal emails to them, they finally credited my account and removed the {$1.00} late fee. In XX/XX/XXXX of this year, they wrote me a letter closing this account ( ending in XXXX ) stating "" too many late payments '' on this account. The fact is that there were ZERO late payments for this account, so I called and spoke to XXXX separate representatives for this institution. The first said she saw no evidence of any late payments that would warrant closing the account in the records on the account. The second person I spoke with was a XXXX who looked into this and my other account with the bank, and she said that the XXXX account was in good status, however my other account had XXXX missed payments ( in XXXX and XXXX of XXXX ), even though it was paid up to date. I explained that while I received notice of payments due on that unrelated account, I was still being prevented from Bank of America from accessing the account to make online payments, Again, after XXXX months of internal online correspondence and multiple phone calls, I was able to once again access my account and changed my profile back to my original XXXX and password. Then, and only then was I able to make the payments. The Supervisor told me she would re-establish my account and send out a new card. She furthermore credited my account with the XXXX late fee assessments ( posting on XX/XX/XXXX ). She further apologized for the problems created by Bank of America and said she would look into the reports to credit agencies to get them corrected to show accurate information and no late payments. Consequently I received another letter from Bank of America dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX stating that they "" were unable to approve my recent request to reopen '' my account, citing "" too many accounts with balances and the amount owed on revolving accounts is too high. '' This is, of course, inaccurate and a false statement relative to my income and past history of credit card use and accounts.
