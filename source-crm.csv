On XXXX XXXX, I received a response from XXXX XXXX XXXX stating that Citi confirmed my account was enrolled in the promotional offer. The communication went on to list out my progress toward completing the requirements ( XXXX out of XXXX were completed at the time ), and contained an affirmative statement that the Aadvantage miles would be credited to my account following my completion of the last requirement. On XXXX XXXX, 2016, via secure message, I again contacted Citi to inform them that I had completed the last of my requirements, and sought to know when I should expect the miles to be credited to my account. The Citigold representative ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) responded on XXXX XXXX, 2016, in writing, stating that I had indeed completed all requirements associated with the aforementioned promotion code, and that, per the terms and conditions of the offer, I would receive the miles 90 days from the end of the statement cycle in which the requirements were completed. The Representative further stated that the miles would be credited to my Aadvantage account by XXXX/XXXX/2016. I accepted this as true, and after waiting over three months and still having not received the miles, I again contacted Citigold via secure message on XXXX/XXXX/2016 to inquire about the miles that should have posted. I received a reply ( from a XXXX XXXX ) the following day stating that Citibank now deems me ineligible for the offer, because, they contend, that this was a "" targeted promotion to which ( I was ) not a participant. '' The Citi representative went on to state that though I met the requirements, this does not render me eligible for the promotion ( which is in direct conflict with what the other Citi representative told me three months ago ). Citi 's sudden reversal of position after confirming my eligibility and going so far as to tell me a specific date when to expect the promo miles to transfer to my account is a reprehensible act. They held out an offer to induce my business, I accepted, and even went out of my way to confirm that their records indicated that I had met the terms of the offer, and received such confirmation, only to be told three months later that Citi has now decided not to honor their offer. This is a classic bait-and-switch tactic.

I realized this after an hour and immediately called Chase and my other credit card companies to cancel all of my credit cards. The thief did try to buy things and succeeded at spending about {$50.00} on food but was declined from spending over {$400.00} at Target. When I called Chase, I informed them that my wallet had been stolen. I got all my credit and debit cards canceled and re-issued, however Chase did not put a fraud alert on my accounts. Then, 10 days later, someone went into a Chase branch in XXXX, IL and impersonated me using my license, forged my signature and withdrew almost all the money from my checking and savings accounts. I realized this two days later and went to a Chase branch in person to close all of my accounts. When I went to my local Chase branch, the banker I was working with actually admitted that it was negligent for them to have not put any fraud warning on my accounts when I told them that my wallet had been stolen. He also said it was very unusual for someone to actually walk into a bank and impersonate someone else and withdraw money. He helped me file claims and told me it would take 10 business days for me to be refunded. The Chase banker told me that Chase will do their own investigation to figure out how and why this teller allowed someone who was n't me to withdraw my money but also told me that I was n't allowed to know anything about the investigation - I would not be told any results. He told me they 'd have to "" investigate '' to make sure that I was n't scamming them - pretending that my money was gone when in fact I had withdrawn it myself. I filed police reports and everything as well. Well, it has now been 13 business days and I have not been refunded. I just contacted Chase Claims department and without an apology they told me "" it '' just was n't done yet, meaning the "" investigation '' to make sure that I was n't making all this up. The woman on the phone acknowledged that it had been over their stated 10-day turnaround but offered me nothing else than a "" you 'll have to call back in 2-3 days.

'' I was already really angry at Chase for a ) not putting a fraud alert on my account when they knew my wallet had been stolen and b ) allowing some teller to distribute my money to a criminal who had impersonated me and now I 'm utterly disgusted with them for their lack of concern, negligence and slowness in resolving what was a HUGE mistake on their part. And I do n't even know IF they will be reimbursing me - they may come back and say that they think I 'm scamming them. On top of all of this, I set up security questions to be asked when I call over the phone. I just called them today and was not asked any of the security questions - just my name and address. And guess what? The person who stole my wallet has all of that information and could have easily pretended to be me. Chase needs to implement some better security procedures, such as asking a security question when you go to withdraw large amounts of money, and actually implementing the security questions when they say they will.

Considering how and when it happens it is even more suspicious that it is retaliatory despite USBank having claimed zeal at resolving the previous matter that itself was not motivated.

If USBank does not appreciate that I use its service only for one of its services ( XXXX XXXX ), then it could inform me with a proposal to that effect. It has never done so.

There was a transfer of money from one friends account to another but the transfer resulted from a misunderstanding. My account was affected because I also received a transfer from the account suspected of fraud. It was n't fraud but just a misunderstanding like I said. The day after this transfer, my account is locked and I no longer have any access to my funds. I find this out after attempting to make a purchase at XXXX.

I call the contact center immediately and get told that my account is under investigation and will be until the XXXX of XXXX and this is on the XXXX. Now I have a family and bills and a ton of responsibilities that require attention and money. I ca n't attend to those without monetary funds. I have been calling the customer center everyday since I found out about this and I 'm usually given these cookie-cutter/fabricated responses that help no one. As days pass I begin to become more and more frustrated by the disappointing low level of help and assistance I receive.

Long story short, the misunderstanding has already been cleared up at a much lower level like it should have been but the NFCU security department still has to pursue this ghost investigation that they are taking their time to complete.
