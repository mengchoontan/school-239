5/11/16,Bank account or service,Other bank product/service,"Account opening, closing, or management",None,"I had a PayPal account. It was linked to a Bill-Me-Later credit account. I eventually was unable to pay the Bill-Me-Later balance, so the account went into collections. I paid a small settlement and the remainder was reported to the IRS as a forgiveness of debt. This was a couple of years ago. Now I have decided to close my PayPal account and they are refusing to close it because of the charge-off they have recorded with Bill-Me-Later. I do n't care if they keep a record of the Bill-Me-Later account, but I want my PayPal account closed completely. They have said they can block all access to the account, but that they can not close it. I 'm sorry, but that 's unacceptable. I want nothing to do with PayPal. Again, I understand they need to keep the record of the settlement with PayPal Credit, but these are XXXX separate entities, one providing online financial transactions and the other providing credit services. They should be able to be unlinked for the purposes of closing a PayPal account. I have been trying for over a month just to close my account. I have spoken with numerous people in PayPal and PayPal Credit over this time, spending hours on hold, hours explaining repeatedly what the problem is, speaking with supervisors and so-called executive escalation representatives, lied to that someone would call back, and getting stonewalled every time.

05/29/15,Bank account or service,Checking account,"Account opening, closing, or management",None,"I formerly used Bank of the West in California for all my financial needs. On XXXX/XXXX/15 this financial institution forcefully closed my joint account without my authorization using funds from XXXX of my individual accounts to cover the overdrawn balance ( {$300.00} ). I was never contacted by this institution to inform me of the transfer of funds or the forced closure of the joint account. I would have covered the overdraft if I had known about it. The joint account was shared by myself and my wife, I only used it to transfer funds when she needed it. Since the account was operated and maintained by my wife, I was unaware of the negative balance. I contacted this institutions telephone customer service before XXXX/XXXX/15 to ask if the funds were wrongfully transferred and if the account was in fact closed. They informed me that it was in fact forceably closed. I than asked for copies of any and all disclosures which I may have signed on the account and or more particularly, the XXXX which releases the need for my personal authorization to transfer funds between account I hold. The representative than sounded confused and informed me that this financial institution does not need my approval to cover negative balances on accounts and that there are no disclosures associated with this account which they could provide me with. I know for a fact that there must at least be the disclosures I signed to open the account. I than asked to speak to a supervisor at which time, the representative informed me that the call center had already closed and she was the only person left in the building. I requested to see if some of the fees for this account which were well over XXXX percent of the overdue balance could be waived or partially waived to relieve some of the hardship which seemed so wrongfully poised in my position. I was instructed to talk to the branch which holds ownership of my accounts. This branch is in XXXX XXXX, CA. It is XXXX miles from my account. I requested long ago to have my accounts transfered to XXXX XXXX, CA. I was informed that the ownership of my account was not able to be changed and that I should close the accounts I had previously opened in XXXX XXXX, CA and than open new accounts with the branch in XXXX XXXX, CA. I declined to close these accounts since I did not see a need to burden myself with changing all of my finances to reflect the new account numbers. On XXXX/XXXX/15 I entered this financial institution 's branch in XXXX, CA on XXXX XXXX to close my remaining Individual Checking Account and move on to another financial institution. When my turn in line came, I told the teller at the window that I would like to close my account. The teller handed me {$1200.00}. I asked him if the account was now closed. He confirmed closure of the account. Today, XXXX/XXXX/15 I received an overdraft notification from this institution for the account which they had confirmed to have closed on XXXX/XXXX/15. I contacted customer service. I requested to speak to a supervisor. Once online, I started from the beginning informing her of the joint accounts forced closure. She reiterated that the institution does not require a signed disclosure to transfer personal funds. I asked for copies of the disclosures on my account. None have been provided. The supervisor once again told me that nothing can be reversed from within the call center and I would have to return to the branch. I talked to her about the individual accounts closure. She told me that there is no papertrail proving my intent to close the account. I have since incurred an autodebit and monthly service charge which have forced the account into the negative, an account which should have been closed. I feel that this institution has wronged me. I feel that they are in the business to collect fees solely. I feel that they do not care.

The current address problem started when we moved and changed our address in approximately XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/2013.

On XXXX XXXX, 2016, I opened the account with XXXX XXXX XXXX at the XXXX, PA XXXX Branch of Santander Bank. By deception, XXXX XXXX failed to offer or order an ATM/Debit card for the subject checking account, expecting that Santander Bank will impose fees on this account. I had to call Santander Customer Service three times before I received an ATM/Debit card and this caused more inconvenience to me. I am told that some Santander Bank employees engage in such deception to increase fees revenues. XXXX XXXX told me that any direct deposit of {$500.00} or more from any business entity made within 90 days of the subject checking account will qualify for {$150.00} Bonus. On XXXX XXXX, 2016, a business entity XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX made a direct deposit payment of {$530.00} to the above captioned account fully complying with the {$150.00} Bonus offer that Santander Bank, N.A. made online to solicit checking account customers. According to the terms and conditions of the {$150.00} Bonus offer ( copy attached ), it specifically states : - Direct deposits include deposits made by your employer or a federal or state government agency or retirement benefits administrator and generally payments made by corporations or other organizations. It does not include deposits to your Account that are made by an individual using online banking or an Internet payment provider such as XXXX. The direct deposit of {$530.00} was made by a business entity, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. It certainly was NOT made by an individual. See attached Bank Statement. The Santander Bank, XXXX PA XXXX Branch Manager XXXX XXXX XXXX was contacted about this matter and he chose to make misrepresentations about qualifying for the {$150.00} Bonus. He stated that the direct deposit must be from a payroll company like XXXX or XXXX which is grossly false and that kind of condition was never disclosed when the subject account was opened. Nowhere in the Terms and Conditions shown above ( copy attached ) does it state a requirement for Direct Deposit to be made exclusively by XXXX or XXXX. This same excuse of Direct Deposit has to be made by a payroll company ( XXXX or XXXX ) was repeated by the Santander Bank Customer Service call center Staff. It is evident that the systemic problem of deceptively soliciting new checking account customers with {$150.00} bonus is further compounded by Santander Employees being trained to mislead the customers that they are not entitled to the {$150.00} bonus unless XXXX or XXXX ( exclusively ) provides the direct deposit of {$500.00} or more. See attached copy of email sent by the owner and founder of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to Santander Bank Branch Manager XXXX XXXX XXXX who chose to ignore and refused to respond to several reminders/calls about the lapses. As one of the many customers who was solicited and deceived by Santander Bank, I am writing to you XXXX XXXX as the CEO and President of the bank, to get assurance that {$150.00} Bonus owed to me will be credited on the subject account immediately.

I verified with Citi bank customer service that they had received the money - they said yes. I then asked if there was any thing else they needed from me for opening this checking account - Citi customer service responded no everything is complete.

As it turns out suddenly they created a bogus issue with my primary home address - saying that it did n't exist and they could n't verify it so they were closing my account. Odd since they had sent multiple mailings to my primary address were I received from Citi a checkbook, another time a atm card, another time a pin number that I used to activate my atm card and I sent them a copy of my phone bill that has my primary address on it. Also the wire transfer came from XXXX XXXX XXXX with documents that have my primary home address on them. None of this mattered they still closed the account!! Coincidently that they closed it right before the day that I would qualify for the {$400.00} dollars for them to have to pay in to my account?? I think no coincidence - clearly it is a scam for this bank raise fast cash from Americans never planning on paying {$400.00} dollars -- just a scam -- total scam. Example even if XXXX XXXX Americans fall for this Citi scam multiplied by XXXX each equals {>= $1,000,000} XXXX dollars of quick cash for whatever Citi needs. Further if they do not pay out the {$400.00} dollars by closing accounts early then Citi saves another {>= $1,000,000} XXXX dollars of expenses.

Then two Citi supervisors told me that the closing check would be mailed to me and if it got lost the Citi bank was not responsible for the lost money. WOW!! more Shock!! I called US Federal reserve that assured me that Citi is totally liable for the closing check and if lost in the mail Citi would just have to send me another check - Relief!! and Peace of mind.

I needed to withdraw about XXXX dollars to purchase a car, and Chase did not have any system set up where my brother could approve me for a withdrawal or add me to his account while we were in different states. Chase has been prompting me for about a year to open up a Chase account via Quickpay, and that seemed to be the best way to get the money fast, so I opened up a Chase Checking account. Before we even left the bank, it turns out people were messing things up and not caring about it. I mentioned my quickpay account BEFORE setting up the new checking account, and ASKED if they could be merged. They said "" Absolutely. '' What the employees actually did was just go ahead and delete the quickpay account so I could start a new one with the same email. Over a year of banking records tied to that account and they just deleted it WITHOUT SO MUCH AS A WORD. This is technically mega-fail number one. Within days, I cashed a check into this account from another established Chase account ( every single account in this story belongs to Chase, which makes it more ridiculous ). Even though it was from another Chase account, the check did not cash quickly. Four or five days later, I signed into the account and the check showed cashed. I repeat, IT SHOWED CASHED AND SHOWED THE BALANCE IN MY ACCOUNT. Last night I tried to sign into my account and check my balance, and found my entire account blank online. I called up, and was told my account had literally been deleted, and could not be told why. So I went into the bank today in person to find out What on Earth is going on. I was told the check required some kind of manual verification process, and that they mailed me a letter about it? I was told, even though the check ALREADY SHOWED CASHED, that it was somehow flagged for fraud/manual approval and did not get that approval ; so they closed the entire bank account. Best of all, when I went into the bank today to then collect my money from my closed account, I was informed a check had been mailed ( to somewhere I no longer live, and have been telling Chase from the beginning that I do n't live there ), and that was it. I was told they could not cancel the check and issue me the money they disappeared on the spot ( which is probably incorrect, someone probably refused to do it that way because 'Policy and Procedure ' ). Why they even mailed out a check in the first place is weird considering THEY CLAIMED THEY COULD N'T VERIFY IT. So in summary : Chase could n't verify a cashed check from Chase account to Chase account, in over 10 days ... Chase actually showed the balance in the account, despite the fact they claim the check did not pass manual verification? Closed the entire account? FOR WHAT? Claim the check was not verifiable, but mailed out the money anyway? Failed to correct this comedy of incompetence when it was brought to their attention in person at a Chase location. Cashed checks go on and off like light switches with Chase? Sometimes they are approved, and then WHAM, all of a sudden they are not again? NEVER ONCE CALLED, EMAILED, OR ESPECIALLY PUT A NOTICE IN THAT 'IMPORTANT BANKING ALERTS ' SECTION IN YOUR ONLINE ACCOUNT. All of this other stuff might have been understandable, or acceptable, IF THERE HAD BEEN A HALFWAY DECENT COMMUNICATION ATTEMPT, WHICH THERE WAS NOT, BEFORE CLOSING THE ACCOUNT.

Anyway, over the last few days I find articles in the XXXX and the XXXX XXXX, where employees describe being bullied and coerced into closing and opening customer 's accounts repeatedly, presumably in effort to generate new account volume and new account fees.

Less then a week later Chase bank blocked and started closing my account.

How is this my fault? '' Eventually I 'm told that JP Morgan Chase will be holding my money hostage, I 'm paraphrasing, until I bring my employer to a chase bank branch. From our neighborhood, where my employer and I both reside, its a 5-8 hour trip, depending on traffic and ferry to visit a branch. My employer is being asked to loose XXXX dollars in production to close shop for a day, loose sleep to catch a ferry, pay for ferry fees and gas on top of it. I understand his hesitation to accompany me and insistence that I find another way. My employer has looked into just stopping the check and reissuing me one, but his bank, XXXX XXXX, has already released the funds. Furthering my frustration, I also bank here locally on the XXXX at XXXX bank. I keep my same old Chase bank account so I can send money to my grandmother who also banks there, and because it was linked to a decade old insurance settlement which makes a large annual deposit. I would have deposited the paycheck locally if not for needing to get XXXX dollars to my grandmother ASAP. On my local account I noticed I was going to need money from the Chase account to cover a few checks I had written, the most important was to pay for court and probation on my suspended licence. I decided to bite the bullet and pay the fee for a wire transfer, it would be immediate rather then waiting the usual 2 days to transfer some money from Chase to XXXX. I left the chase account money for Grandma, some to cover what ever fees, and a little for a buffer, the rest was to go to XXXX. I scheduled it for the next day, the day my paycheck was projected to clear. That was the day Chase closed my account. As a result of the failed wire XXXX Checks I wrote bounced including the XXXX to court, I do n't know if I 'm violating probation or not and I 'm denied access to funds to fix it. My reputation with my local bank and a few small locally owned businesses is now tarnished as a result of Chase banks over reaction, and the bounced checks that resulted, as well as a few insufficient funds fees and a few returns on unfunded internet orders. Being associated with the frustration of this situation is causing my insecurity to manifest in a perception that my value as an employee is diminishing.

I am not even worried. I happened to go to the branch the other day, and check on the status of the card. I was told that I had to provide further information, namely, ( Apt number ), which I then did. Next, the banker told me that your card will be mailed out to you soon. So far, no stress and everything is cool. I walk out, and next day, which is literally this day ( Friday ) I try to buy some food using my debit card, but could n't. Debit Card was never accepted by all machines. Things started to get weird! I then tried to get some cash via an ATM, however, it kept declining the transactions. I then went straight to the closest bank branch, which is at the University XXXX. I was trying to explain what 's going on, and understand the problem, yet bankers -including the manager- were being too unhelpful.

I got disappointed, and walked out. I tried to call the bank thinking they my be of a help. Lucky I was, at least was informed what the problem was, which totally ended up being unpleasant. After verifying of my identity, they told me that my debit card has been deactivated. And the reason is because another card will have been mailed to you. My answer was Seriously?? It just does n't make no sense to deactivate all my working debit cards ( XXXX ) because you are sending me another one for another checking that has not even been received, and without any temporary cards! Simply, I have been blocked out of my accounts. I was no longer able to get any money out of my money just because of that! I could n't use the card, and I could n't do anything else.

When inquired about account status, TCF branch manager would not reveal what had happened to my cash at various trust accounts except they were stolen by my spouse. He would n't tell me where the money was because I was not authorized to know without having my social security number in the accounts. TCF bank was aware of something but was not willing to reveal.

5/4/16,Bank account or service,Savings account,"Account opening, closing, or management",None,"My mother recently passed away. I have spent the last few weeks tending to her affairs and paying off any debt. She managed her finances well, and wanted to honor her memory by being thorough. One set of accounts at wells Fargo, was a checking ( we had joint as I provided her funds monthly ), savings, and a IRA. She had left me beneficiary on the Checking and IRA but she was apparently not aware she needed to do anything for the savings. We are both immigrants, I grow up in the US. We have no other family. So she was not very familiar with all the administrative things all ways needed. Her Savings account was the large liquid account I was using to pay her debt off and close her business licenses, etc. Before death, she gave me a Durable Power of Attorney for Financial, Property, and Healthcare. Upon receiving her Death Certificate I notified Wells Fargo. However, the following events occurred which I feel Wells Fargo failed to provide adequate disclosures and did not act in the best interest of its customers. 1. When I notified the phone rep of the death, he put a block on all her accounts, even though I was listed as beneficiary and I identified myself. He did not disclose the block. This almost caused some issues with her debt payments. 2. When I went to the branch to show the Death Certificate, my ID, the Power of Attorney, they created a new checking account and transferred the checking account funds. I was not notified of this. Again, another failure of disclosure. I wanted to keep the old account as my mom has had it since I was a child going back to XXXX XXXX in XXXX. It was something I wanted to maintain to remember her. Wells robbed me of that. I figure that they would have to clearly notify me of this rather than doing it behind a terminal without communication. 3. Even though I am beneficiary on all her other accounts, she missed one account setup and have to go through probate despite having Power of Attorney during her life and beneficiary for all else. Regardless, I feel Wells Fargo is doing a disservice here. There is a huge population of baby boomers. I assume many do n't have every beneficiary field filled out. Wells could easily do data mining for empty fields for all depositors and as a courtesy, prompt them on login to update. This problem could have been solved beforehand. I assume there are going to be tens of thousands, if not millions of other families that have a similar situation or will upon a lived ones death. I feel banks could do more here to make sure transition is easier for the loved ones so they can focus on grieving vs the bureaucracy and pain Wells is putting my family through. I am paying off her remaining items on my own, which is fine. The funds will be released upon the judges signature, but the issue could have been avoided had Wells had more thoughtful proactive risk practices given its clients missing data fields. A simple query could easily ID other depositors with the same issue. So much frustration could be saved. 4. Given our aging population, seems there should be more uniformity of federal banking requirements on how to deal with beneficiaries. Having done this not, seems like its all over the place. Some banks do beneficiaries online, others only Trusts, or you have to go to a branch. It is not uniform. Some banks are easier, others are near impossible to deal with.

04/20/16,Bank account or service,Checking account,"Account opening, closing, or management",None,"My husband and I have had a joint account for 20 years at the same bank. We have been loyal customers and have a checking, a savings, and a couple money market accounts. Over the years, the services have become less generous and recently I have had two very bad experiences that I do not think are legal. First, my bankcard and access to my bank account was cut off because I had not activated a new card that they had sent to me 5 months ago ( that I never received ). When I realized I could not get access to my account, I called and they said they would send me a new card in two days. I had no access to my account electronically or physically and I was unable to transfer money to cover a property tax check. My husband had to go to the bank to do it. Which brings me to the next complaint. We used to have over {$14000.00} credit as an overdraft account. As a busy household with XXXX incomes and young kids, we used this overdraft account often for credit whenever we needed the flexibility for timing of expenses. We have paid plenty of interest to the bank for this flexibility. Late last year the account was reduced to {$300.00}. This amount for us covers very little when you are talking about {$12000.00} of activity during the course of a month. We did get a letter from the bank saying that they were reducing it due to "" my husband 's delinquency '' ( there were none - it is a joint account under good standing ) ; "" insufficient deposit relationship '' ; and I was listed as an "" unqualified co-borrower ''. None of this made sense. When I went to the bank recently, I inquired about it and they said I would have to reapply for it like any other credit source. They also said the reduction was due to a low credit score and debt to income ratio. How would they know what my debt to income ratio was? They said we could see his credit report. Why did they use just his credit report and not mine for a joint account? My credit score and earnings are much higher. We have always paid our bills on time and do not have any debt under this bank anymore. ( I suspect we are being punished for moving our debt elsewhere. ) I believe these actions have been, at worst, discriminatory and illegal ; and, at best, very bad customer service.

07/17/15,Bank account or service,Checking account,"Account opening, closing, or management",None,"My name is XXXX XXXX and I would like to relay an unfortunate story of my experience with TCF National Bank. It is my contention that TCF is conducting fraudulent, misleading, and deceptive practices, in transactions regarding the processing and posting of checks, and subsequent overdraft fees charged by the bank. I had only been a customer at TCF for about XXXX months when I decided to write my first check to a business for tree services, for {$170.00}. I was watching several times daily for the check to come thru on my online account register, as my TCF account was used on a daily basis. On Tuesday, XXXX XXXX, at the end of the business day ( XXXX XXXX ), I checked my account balance, and saw a positive balance of {$180.00}, indicating that the check had NOT posted to my account, by the end of the business day, on XX/XX/XXXX. On Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX, I saw that the check had posted to my balance ( both available balance and total balance ), and had brought my available balance into the negative. Seeing this, I deposited {$100.00} into the account prior to the end of the business day, and brought the balance back into the positive. In other words ; I had a positive available balance at the end of the business day on XX/XX/XXXX, and then again on XX/XX/XXXX. There was not any one day that my account was in the negative, at the end of the business day, while banking at TCF bank. Not ever. However, TCF apparently was desperate for their {$37.00} overdraft fee, so they decided to get creative. Even though TCF did not process the {$170.00} check until XX/XX/XXXX, they changed their records to reflect that it posted to my account on XX/XX/XXXX, even though it had not. When I went into the bank the day the check posted on the XX/XX/XXXX to deposit money so the check would not overdraft, the teller told me that the check had posted that day ( not the previous day ). But by XX/XX/XXXX my online account register showed that the check posted on XX/XX/XXXX, which it had not!! This is Fraud!!! My available account balance was {$180.00} at the end of the business day on XX/XX/XXXX according to TCF 's online register and the check had not posted, but the bank fraudulently changed the date on their records, to show that the check posted to my account the day prior!! The transaction information report that I printed off the TCF web site, showed the "" Date/Time Initiated '' as XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX ( curiously 1 minute before the next day ), yet it also showed the "" Date/Time Posted '' as XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, earlier in the day!! This was blatantly false, and what I consider fraud! How could the check be initiated a minute before midnight, yet posted earlier in the day? The check did not post to my account until XX/XX/XXXX, yet they cookedtheir records to show that it posted the previous day, so that they could swindle {$37.00} from me. On Thursday XX/XX/XXXX, I went to my local TCF branch ( XXXX location ), and spoke to a rude and indifferent branch manager named XXXX. XXXX told me that even though my available balance showed a balance of {$180.00} at the end of the business day on XX/XX/XXXX, and that the check was processed on XX/XX/XXXX, it was ok for them to back date the check to the prior day, because the check was processed through the federal reserve bank, and that may not have shown up on my available balance until the next day ; thus they get to charge their overdraft fee. When I explained that I had never had an overdraft of any kind while a customer at their bank, XXXX early rolled his eyes. XXXX was rude, indifferent and extremely condescending towards me during our conversation. Needless to say, XXXX refused to waive the one and only overdraft fee that I had received while banking at TCF. This practice of backdating checks to the prior day, even though it had not posted until the following day, is straight-up fraud.

I told my husband and next morning, he called the Sun Trust Bank customer service. He explained the situation to the agent. The agent looked at our accounts and found that the money market account was closed and another new one was opened. But that new one was not showing on our online banking. He fixed it so we can see the balance. And he said the account should n't have been open without our permission. He said he will make a report. 7. The next day, my sister and I went to see the manager of the branch where I bank. He checked his computer and saw that there was no "" Signed Card '' that authorized opening a new account. He said that ca n't be allowed. He called the teller who did this, and the lady acted like it was someone else. She left the room, and the manager said he will make sure that person who did this will be disciplined. We left. 8. The next few times I went into the bank to make the deposit, I did n't see the teller. So I assumed that she was fired. 9. Then a few months later, I saw her at the same bank. And she has been promoted to a loan officer! At least that is what I assumed since she was sitting behind the loan officer section of the bank. I was furious. I wanted to report to someone about this, but did n't know where. I also found out that when a new bank account is opened each time, our credit score gets a hit. So there you have my story about the illegal opening of the bank account done by the Sun Trust. I read online that the account that has over {$50000.00} is considered a gold mine because the person who processes it gets the highest possible commission. I hope this gets known to the officials who investigate these problems.

The next day my partner made a withdrawl of {$7400.00} to purchase equipment from the funds we recieved from the church. This was Grant Money. The next day I found out the bank had called the police for fraudulant activity on our account and the church account.

( not knowing that the check was bad ) This is what happened to me. Now I know if anyone gives me a check in the future, I call the bank that is listed on the check and verify if the check is good before depositing it into my account. So now BOA thinks I am the fraudulent person, when it was n't I that created the check it was someone else from the internet that sent it to me via mail and I was naive employee that thought I was getting paid and to payout a portion to other employees in other countries. Therefore, because BOA thinks I am the fraud when it was my employer that is the fraud for sending me the check and it was a good thing I waited for it clear, I would have sent out my own money and I would have lost lots of money in my BOA account. Now BOA placed my name with "" XXXX '' and "" XXXX '' preventing me from opening a bank account in my neighborhood so I can do my banking.

The bank recently on XXXX XXXX, 2015 allowed this person to close my account, open a new account with my money, and also withdraw money. This person was also allowed to claim many of my purchases as fraud in an attempt to get more money. I found out about the incident when I tried to use my bank card to pay for parking and it was declined. I called customer service to see what the problem was, only to be told that they could not help me unless I had the fraud claim reference number ( the report which I did not file ). The bank did not follow any protocol by asking for the verbal password. Instead, I was left unable to have access to my money until I was able to go into a branch and prove my identity. After the bank verified that this was a false fraud claim, the bank still moved forward with honoring the claim. Many of the purchases, which included personal bills and other business expenses, were returned to the bank. This reversal of payment caused me to incur canceled check fees, shut-off notices, and I had to buy my XXXX back since the hosting service was XXXX of the purchases filed on the false fraud claim. I had to repay all of those bills with my own money to avoid more fees and to keep my utilities in service. Later, the bank gave me a credit of {$1300.00} which was part of the amount filed as fraud. I went into a branch to verify what the credit was for, and I was told that this was my money because the bank realized that they made a mistake. The bank ended up taking the credit back from me, leaving my account negative over {$1100.00}. The bank said that they took the credit back because they realized that I was the one who made the purchases and that they could not honor my claim. The credit was not listed as a temporary credit ( as they usually list it as temporary until they finish the investigation ). I explained to them that I was not the one who made the claim and that I was told that the credit was given to me because of the money that had already been returned to the bank from the merchants. It then became a problem with miscommunication because none of the bank 's departments understood what was going on even after I explained it to them many times. The problem is that now, I still dont have the money that the bank took from the merchants, nor do I have the credit they gave me. When the person filed the false claim, they also were allowed to withdraw cash, which the bank did not honor. So I am out of all of this money and the bank has not lost anything.

Four weeks ago, I received a very large wire deposit from a client. It was my company 's largest sale to date. After the funds cleared, I attempted to send payments as wire transfers to all my vendors, none of which went through. That is what alerted me to the issue. Chase did not contact me with any fraud alerts. I just stopped having access to the account. At first, Chase explained that they identified some fraudulent activity. They were concerned that my account had experienced a large spike in activity. I was asked, then verified all charges as legitimate. The Chase rep stated that my account would be cleared by next business day. Still no access by next business day. When I followed up, the Chase rep then stated that they were investigating the source of the large wire transfer and I had to provide all of my invoices and tax returns to prove that I was a legitimate business. They did not provide this information willingly, though. Chase stated that under the Patriot Act, they do not have to explain themselves. However, I provided all requested documents. To date, I had been in business for over 2 years. Chase then stated I had to wait 10 business days for the investigation to clear. I did and the account was still frozen. After doing some searching regarding people who have experienced similar situations with Chase, I found that Chase had an Executive Customer Service office dedicated to solving out-of-ordinary issues. I called them. The rep was very apologetic and stated that my account would be accessible next business day. Next day, the account was still frozen.

05/18/16,Bank account or service,Checking account,"Account opening, closing, or management",None,"I have been a member of Pentagon Federal Credit Union ( PENFED ) since 1999. During my tenure at the Penfed, I have often been offered many products and services ( i.e. Credit Cards ) ; but, each time I have applied I have been denied. As time went on, I began to notice a pattern and came to suspect blatant discrimination and began to challenge their quick denials. Four times I was turned down for a mere personal loan of XXXX before finally being approved after having to provide a number of documents, complain to the board, and speaking to high level managers. The loan was PAID IN FULL on time and early. Yet, when I asked for an additional loan, I was promptly denied. Yet, I began noticing how they would cater to the Latinos and Hispanics who were n't even born in this country, yet were able to get loans and anything else. Recently, I have also been noticing that PenFed is now starting to advertise : 'Great Rates for Everyone '. Yet, if this be true, then why do I continue to be denied products and services? Most recently, I was denied a car loan having been told : 'You have never had a loan like this before. ' What? Presumably, they were referring to an installment loan whereby, I had one from PenFed and a Student Loan. Prior to this, I was denied the {$500.00} Credit Protection on my Checking Account and then scolded when my account was depleted. If that were n't enough at one point, they serendipitously removed funds from my Savings into the Checking account in an futile attempt to bring the account current. I needed to stop a payment on a check whereby I was charged a fee. Unbeknownst to me, this fee could have been avoided if I had initiated the stop payment online. I was n't made aware of this until I called and was attempting to stop payment on another check. Much to my chagrin, I was not at all pleased. Truth is, I have been extremely unhappy and frustrated with PenFed for quite awhile because it is my firm belief and despite their denials, that I have been discriminated against and continues to this day. In terms of the car loan, I was expecting to take advantage of the low rates offered by Credit Unjons. Yet, as previously mentioned, I was denied. I did receive a car loan for the XXXX I had requested from PenFed ; but, at a much higher interest rate than is necessary. I also recently received a new XXXX Card. Hence, why am I not able to take advantage of all the products and services that as a member of this Credit Union offers?

It is extremely frustrating to be a member of a Credit Union only to seek products and services outside of the CU in order to prove my credit worthiness before you will even consider taking a chance on me. That in itself is blatant discrimination because I have been told in the past that it is best that I find another creditor to take a chance before we do. Also, it is annoying to constantly hear how conservative they are. This fact is abundantly clear.

He stated that I can cancel services whenever I want with no obligations. I never even signed a contract nor received XXXX. In fact I received the register in the mail and had to set it up myself. Often times I had to call because there were so many different fees coming out of my account and I questioned it. I was either being charged because of different payments I received from my clients, service charges, taxes, etc. Before even closing my account I was notified by my bank that fraudulent activity was occurring on my account and they needed to change my account. When having concerns with the machine I was told to call my salesperson XXXX XXXX Which was fired because he was doing false advertisement of the machine and taking funds from consumers. At this time I was closing my business account anyway. I tried to contact First Data on numerous occasions since XXXX XXXX to find out the process of cancelling my services. I was told that I needed to return the equipment and I could not cancel services because I was signed to a contract. If I wanted to buyout I had to pay for 40mths of {$73.00}. I told them that I never signed a contract and they needed to investigate the sale because the salesperson never told me about the terms or conditions nor sent me a contract. The salesperson told me he would mail me out a contract for me to sign and I would have to mail it back in. I never received a contract, however, First Data was continuing to debit my account. However, once I closed the account in XXXX I kept calling to make them aware that the account was closed, I no longer needed services and they would not receive payment. Every time I called they would give me the run around to say that they would send me the contract I supposedly signed and will give me a dispute letter, I still have not received anything. When I asked to talk to the manager, they manager said the same them. I never received a call back, contract, or dispute form to fill out. However, they did give me instructions on how to return the equipment with leasing number XXXX, which I returned the first week of XXXX. I had to pay {$45.00} to mail the equipment back. I tracked the package and emailed First Data letting them know the equipment was being returned with tracking number. After they received the equipment they did not confirm they received it.

I asked her to email and mail me my signed contract and dispute letter. Which she could not confirm that she had. I asked her to email and mail so there would not be any confusion that I did not receive it. She stated she could not do both it had to either be email or mail.

Finally the rep says she will close the account and mail us a bill for the remaining balance on the account ( telling us that they waived a late fee ). 3 weeks go by and we do n't receive anything so we call again. This time we speak with a third rep who tells my wife to mail in a check for XXXX {$30.00} which will close out the account and we 're assured the account will actually be closed this time.

Upon reviewing my records in late XXXX, I noticed that I had n't received account status information from Wells Fargo. When I called Wells Fargo 's toll free line to determine the current account balance, I was transferred between several different offices, none of which was able to pull up the balance. Accordingly, I went in person to their XXXX, NY branch office on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. There, I was told that while there is a record of my XXXX XXXX transfer request, the account could not be located. Since it was obvious the bank had made some kind of error, I expected that Wells Fargo would take the lead in rectifying and made it clear that I expected to be sent a letter disclosing what happened and explaining how I would be made whole. This was not the case. I had to make several additional visits, make numerous calls and send e-mail before I was finally told at last that Wells Fargo corporate would investigate. Finally, in late XXXX XXXX, I was told that the funds would be made available. When I went into a local branch ( XXXX, NY ) to collect the funds, they had no record of the account. When I went back to Wells Fargo 's XXXX NY branch on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I was told that I would have to open a new account into which the funds would be deposited. I was initially told the balance would be over {$800.00} less than the XXXX opening balance of {$2400.00}. Fortunately, I had account documents showing the opening balance. I was then offered the original opening balance with absolutely no interest over the 4.5 years, no explanation of what occurred and no assurance that I would be protected from potential tax liability because of the bank 's error. I advised Wells Fargo that I would not open an account to receive the funds without a letter from them and that I expected reasonable interest. When I went to the XXXX, NY branch on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I was presented with a terse letter acknowledging the bank 's error. I was offered access to funds if I opened a new account, which I reluctantly did, telling the bank that I would be filing a consumer complaint because of their complete lack of transparency in dealing with me. Specifically : Wells Fargo provided absolutely no explanation as to how interest was calculated. In their letter, they claim they provided me with {$5.00} in interest for the 4.5-year- period, yet the balance they provided is only {$0.00} greater than the opening balance. It would appear I am being charged undisclosed balance fees on an account they claim they never actually opened. I was not provided a disclosure statement about interest and fees associated with the new account ( although some disclosure were subsequently mailed after the new account was established ) Given that I received no interest disclosure from Wells Fargo on the account over the four year period, an interest rate of 5 % would seem more appropriate. Wells Fargo has failed to confirm that they would indemnify me should I incur any penalties and fees as a result of their error. Wells Fargo 's letter to me does not really explain what happened. I would like confirmation that my identity was not compromised and that my account was not improperly accessed.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,NY,None,None,Consent provided,Web,03/24/16,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1848944

So the defendant refused to issue new checks, since the money was withdrawn from their account. Fair enough. My bank refused to listen to me. I brought in the settlement documents, I called and spoke to the Manager 's Manager 's Manager 's Manager, still no luck.

My attorney claims that there 's nothing more his firm can do to help ( he got his check ), but he suggested that I might hire an attorney to file a breach of contract claim against the defendant. I believe that the checks were reported counterfeit because the ATM faded out the ink on my larger check.

She suggested we contact your department regarding the correction of this mistake. We opened a checking account at National City Bank in XXXX. At that time, we were sold an overdraft protection line. When we closed the checking in XXXX, the overdraft protection line was not closed. At the beginning of XXXX, we were charged the annual fee on the protection line of credit.

Our address changed in XXXX of XXXX, while our account was still active. We took the proper steps to change the address at that time. In fact, our current address was on file with XXXX when I spoke to her just last month. So, again, PNC made a mistake that is affecting our credit. Frankly, I feel like PNC tried to trick us by not suggesting we close an overdraft protection line on an account we were closing. Why would any reasonable person keep such a line and why would any reasonable person not think they would be closed in tandem when they are sold in tandem? This is dishonest policy. We also find that your company makes it as difficult as possible to resolve disputes, by providing me a XXXX XXXX and department name only, no person, no phone number, to have this matter handled.

01/16/16,Bank account or service,Checking account,"Account opening, closing, or management",None,"Allow me to preface this complaint by saying that I am computer literate and had no problems with the former user interface provided by 5/3 for internet banking. I would also like to say that I called 5/3 a number of times and complained about this issue. I was told to use a register. Complaint : In regard to checking accounts, 5/3 provides a balance. Simple enough. Too simple. The balance means nothing and is, in fact, a deceptive figure that seems to serve only XXXX purpose. To generate overdraft charges. I hope you can follow this explanation. 1 ) Assume you have {$500.00} in your checking account. 2 ) You issue XXXX payments totaling {$400.00}. 3 ) Your balance still says {$500.00}. Very dangerous place to be for the customer. This does not happen when a customer uses a check register, which has been the norm for a hundred years. You deduct all payments issued and trust the balance as accurate of remaining funds. You do not keep writing down {$500.00} for the balance. To further complicate this deceptive practice ... 1 ) The summary page lists all amounts to be paid. 2 ) The list disappears or is reduced in number as each payment is issued by 5/3. So now there is nothing that indicates your account balance is anything different than what shows on the page. 3 ) The problem is that the balance in only an illusion because although you see nothing further is to be paid and the balance should be accurate, in fact, the balance does not reflect the payees failure to cash the payment in a reasonable time frame. 4 ) In other words, you start with {$500.00} and write out {$400.00} against your account on the XXXX of the month. 5/3 issues payment on the XXXX. The payee cashes payment on the XXXX. The result is a misleading balance of {$500.00} one month after issuing payments. You have completely lost track and write an extra payment to a credit card because you notice that it is the end of the month and there is still funds in your account. 4 ) For being dutiful and attentive to you debts, you get charged overdraft and fund transfer fees. The bank may tell you that you are lucky and have overdraft protection, but you still get charged. In conclusion : Computers are mathematical devices that provide visual results of their calculations and to imagine that both a balance and "" available '' balance can not be presented to the customer in order to eliminate this issue is preposterous. There can only be one plausible reason for this practice. Profit for the 5/3 at the customer 's expense. 5/3 does use "" available balance '' when it comes to depositing checks into your account, so why not the other way around??? I would like to say that my bank is above deceptive practices, but this is far from the truth. If you accept the ATM offer to provide you with a balance on your receipt. It will cost you {$2.00} but nothing on the screen ever mentions you will be charged for the service. Only after you look at your statement and are baffled by XXXX or XXXX {$2.00} charges for the month due you get the truth about 5/3. There are more blatant issues, but I am focused on the one that crucifies the average customer.

They said we 'd receive a check for our balance ( of over {$25000.00} ) by mail in 10 days. Two weeks later, I just got off the phone with them and they are refusing to tell me when we will receive our money or under what specific reasons they are holding or what law gives them the authority to do that. The whole saga started when I deposited XXXX checks on XX/XX/2017 worth over {$110000.00}. I was skeptical about checks clearing and asked the cashier at Chase branch. She scanned the checks and told me there was no "" hold '' and that I should keep checking the "" Available Balance '' to know when they have cleared. On XX/XX/2017, the amount of deposited checks showed under "" Available Balance ''. Assuming that the checks were cleared, I initiated a few transactions, one of them being a {$75000.00} transfer to an external account. Chase processed the transfer but when I logged in next day to check something else, I found that all of the deposited checks had returned unpaid due to "" Not Sufficient Funds ''. The account showed a negative balance. I frantically made calls to Chase to reverse the transfer and was told to call their "" Wire Transfer Division ''. After trying several times and spending the long weekend stressed out ( I have never had my business or personal checks bounce, ever ; I have almost perfect XXXX score ), I got hold of someone after trying for an hour. They told me that they could n't reverse the transfer and they had frozen my account. I transferred the money to my another business account with Chase and had my wife go to a branch to manually transfer the money back to the original account. There were too many back and forth transactions in my attempts to resolve the problems but here is a simple version. No one in Chase branches have any authority and they are like human bots who are controlled by a computer algorithm and decisions are conveyed on phone by people who will give only their first name and would transfer me to different division. Also, every time I called - I called over a dozen times - I got a different answer to the same question. Two weeks, I talked to someone on phone and explained that I needed a check of {$10000.00} from my account to open a new account with another bank and resume my business. They told me to go to the branch, which I did. Again, the computer algorithm struck! First they told me I would have to go to a different branch. Reluctantly, I agreed but in a matter of minutes they told me they are closing my accounts and I will get a check for balance in 10 days. I received a letter dated XX/XX/2017 to that effect. After spending 45 minutes on phone with two different persons, no one will tell me when I will get my {$25000.00}, or why they are holding or what gives them the authority. This is a version of Big Brother controlling our lives, except it is not the government but Chase Bank!. It is frightening that Chase refused to accept the blame for the root cause : showing checks cleared when they were not and there was an astounding level of arrogance in how people talked to me. Despite numerous calls and visits to the branch, no one would take ownership of the issue to resolve the problems. They paid a lip service for apologizing to me for inconvenience and then proceeded to tell me they had closed my online access. So I can not download transactions or statements.

They had allowed a checking account to be opened with a token balance and immediate overdraft without contacting us and now seemingly have approved another account ( XXXX ) in our name that we did not apply for. Their fraud department is very difficult to deal with and we find it very troubling that they would allow a second account to be processed after the first event where a checking account was fraudulently opened for {$63.00} and they gave the imposter XXXX initial blank check which they promptly used to overdraw that account. We were able to close out that checking account weeks ago and received verification from Fifth Third just about XXXX days ago that it was investigated and resolved and that we had no liability. However, today we received yet another notice from Fifth Third of a XXXX Account opening and notice of change of home phone number, which again was done fraudulently and with out notice despite having experienced the prior fraud issue. We believe that Fifth Third is not doing their job in verifying identity as required by Federal law and are not being cooperative in preventing the opening of fraudulent accounts or resolving those disputes effectively. After experiencing their weak efforts and response to our identity theft issue I would never voluntarily deal with them for any banking services and would recommend others to think twice before doing so as well.",None,FIFTH THIRD FINANCIAL CORPORATION,IL,600XX,Older American,Consent provided,Web,03/17/17,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2392924

He said that he wanted to verify some personal information with me. Being in public and without me further questioning his real identity, I declined his request and wanted to schedule another time for talking on phone. However, he said that he could not even call me even if he was on the phone at that time. I think this is really ridiculous and finally we agreed that I would call him another time with his numbers. On XX/XX/2017, I tried to use the debit card on XXXX to send money to my friends.The transaction was unsuccessful and the instant email from Wells Fargo said that my account had been closed and delivery preferences had also been updated to the mail one. This really makes me angry because being unable to verify personal information due to inconveniences leads to account closure on the following day. I understand that a bank is not a service institution but Wells Fargo 's action is really annoying and unfriendly to its customers, which leads to my terminations on Wells Fargo 's debit card product. I also want to share another story. When I tried to open the Wells Fargo checking account on line, I used my XXXX credit card to fund the account for {$50.00}. The payment authorization was made in late XX/XX/XXXX. The funny thing was that the money was debited in mid XX/XX/XXXX. Being unable to verify the source of the charge with my card issuer XXXX, I reported this transaction as fraud and my Wells Fargo checking account was closed, or suspended more specifically. To solve this problem, I went to a Wells Fargo branch in XXXX, CA to verify everything, including original and hard copy of SSN card and Driver 's License, and was informed that my account online access would be restored in a moment. However, it was another funny thing that after 3-business-day wait I still could not access my account online and had to call in to get problem solved. I firmly believe it is so much hassle to deal with Wells Fargo. In order to avoid further hassles with Wells Fargo, I firmly request that my Wells Fargo checking account should be closed and the money on the account, around {$49.00}, should be mailed to me by a check.

Parties competent to contract The parties to a contract should be competent, being of the age of consent, of sound mind, not disqualified from contracting by any law to which s/he is subject. A flaw in capacity may be due to minority, lunacy, idiocy, drunkenness or kind. The parties should be of like kind, being either artificial Legal Entity and artificial Legal Entity, or living Man/Woman and living Man/Woman, allowing more than two parties but never a mixture of these kinds. 2. Free and genuine consent The consent of the parties to the agreement must be free and genuine. The consent of the parties should not be obtained by misrepresentation, fraud, undue influence, coercion or mistake. If the consent is obtained by any of these means, then the contract is not valid or lawfully enforceable. 3. Full disclosure When negotiating a contract, full disclosure is the act of providing all material information, or telling the "" whole truth '', about any matter which may influence the decision-making of the other party or parties before they decide to enter into a contract. 4. Sufficient consideration The consideration is something of value possessed by the parties that is brought to the contract table. This something of value is bargained for and given in exchange for a promise or a performance. The parties must each receive a benefit and each suffer a detriment. To be enforceable, a contract must have sufficient consideration. A contract is unenforceable if it has insufficient or unequal consideration without agreement. 5. Certainty of terms The Terms and Conditions of the contract must be fully disclosed and agreed upon, and must be certain and fixed, i.e. not variable as with interest rates. 6. Meeting of the minds A meeting of the minds "" consensus ad idem '', occurs between the parties when they recognise each other, understand their mutual obligations, and agree. This meeting of minds can only occur between like kinds, being Legal Entity with Legal Entity, or Man/Woman with Man/Woman. A corporation and another corporation may enter into contract by way of accommodation parties, and a sentient being and another sentient being may enter into a contract directly, but a corporation and a sentient being together can not enter into a contract as they are not of the same and equal kind. 7. Signatures or autographs Written contracts between Legal Entity actors must carry the wet ink signatures of the parties, each wet ink signature being anaccommodation from a Man/Woman. Written contracts between living Men/Women must carry the wet ink autographs of the parties, and/or living identification such as a thumbprint. Living standing is recognised by a thumbprint, or more often by an unambiguous declaration with the autograph, such as authorised agent written below. 8.

03/30/17,Bank account or service,Checking account,"Account opening, closing, or management",None,"XX/XX/XXXX Dear Sir or Madam : This dispute regards a US Bank "" Easy Checking account '' XXXX, opened at the XXXX, XXXX, WA XXXX branch. In essence, I asked for and opened a simple checking account with US Bank with {$25.00}. Not known to me, this account also contained a {$6000.00} Line of Credit, a Visa Card, and a monthly fee. Despite XXXX activity on the account from inception through today, my credit is in tatters and US Bank will do nothing to help. ( See attached US Bank letters ). What happened : I opened the checking account XX/XX/XXXX to handle the proceeds of a real estate transaction in California, which was then in process. The transaction failed ; although I did sell the property later on a private note. So I did not ever need the US Bank checking account, as all our other financial matters are conducted with XXXX here in XXXX WA. In fact, I have never executed a single transaction of any kind with US Bank, other than opening this account on that day. In fact, I forgot I even had this account. My clear understanding ( see signature card copy attached ) was that I had opened a simple no-fee checking account. Now US Bank does have such a thing ; but apparently it is n't called "" Easy Checking Account ''. The intake person at US Bank wondered why they did n't give me that, while taking my dispute. There was no mention of a Visa card, Line of Credit, or fees at the point of sale. I already have both those items with my primary bank XXXX ( XXXX ). 2 years and 2 months later, here in XX/XX/XXXX, I receive a letter from XXXX, a credit collection agency, asking for {$150.00} in delinquency monies. I was shocked. I returned to the bank branch and asked for an explanation. The Branch Manager told me that attached to my Easy Checking Account was a Line of Credit for {$6000.00} and also a Visa Card. He verified that the credit card had never been activated and the Line of Credit had never been accessed. He also told me that since the LOC and Visa card were attached to my Easy Checking Account, there were monthly fees attached. I had no idea. So what happened was they drew down my initial {$25.00} deposit with the monthly fee, and then when it reached XXXX, began to draw from the Line of Credit to keep the Easy Checking Account afloat. This in turn required monthly payments to the Line of Credit from me. Finally, without so much as a phone call, they closed and "" charged off '' the entire account in XX/XX/XXXX to the XXXX Credit Reporting Agencies. I was aware of none of this. After much discussion, and then phoning US Bank 's dispute area, US Bank sent a letter ( attached ) stating they would do nothing change their delinquency report. So, on the advice of my real bank, XXXX, I paid in full the disputed amount of {$150.00} to the collection agency on XX/XX/XXXX. Some of the fallout from this mess is a 19.5 % increase ( {$340.00} annual increase ) to my auto insurance rates, per my agent, directly attributable to this credit blemish ( attached ). Also, we are attempting to downsize and purchase a new home. My lender has pointed to the XXXX to XXXX points extra I will be paying for a real estate loan. The cost is becoming astronomical ; and the cause of it all is a {$25.00} checking account, issued under what I consider deceptive circumstances. I am now turning to you folks to request that this black mark on my credit be removed from my credit report, and my good credit standing restored. Thank you! XXXX",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,U.S. BANCORP,WA,986XX,Older American,Consent provided,Web,03/30/17,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,No,2411716

Because of the difficulty we encountered, and since we could not get out of our jobs to go into the local branch, we had to wait a day or so ( time to write a letter, gather the information ) and send a fax to our local branch ( we had received the fax number from a personal banker at this location when we had to previously contact an individual there ).

Up till that point, I had never had any inaccurate credit reporting, or felt poorly treated by Navy, and in fact had a stellar reputation with them and a very good credit rating overall. In XX/XX/XXXX, Navy was notified, as were all of my creditors, as to the Bankruptcy proceedings. At that time the accounts mentioned should have been reported to credit bureaus as "" closed ''. Among the accounts with Navy was a {$75000.00} loan for a XXXX ' XXXX boat. After the bankruptcy I contacted Navy by phone several times, had my attorney call, and even went so far as to "" serve '' them with official notice at their headquarters, so as to facilitate surrendering of the boat. I was told by telephone they would "" figure it out '', call me back, or have the right person get in touch with me. Ultimately Navy never responded and I was saddled with the cost of dockage, insurance, upkeep etc., a fact which I made Navy aware of, but they ignored. Navy further refused to cancel the lien on the boat, so I could n't sell it either ( which I could have done and sent the money to Navy ). I could n't just abandon the boat, as the boat is documented in my name and I could be civilly and criminally liable under XXXX and Maritime regulations/laws ; if the boat were to sink, drift into another boat, cause a spill, etc., and at XXXX ' and XXXX lbs, that could be quite a disaster. I felt this was very unfair, especially to a person such as myself who was seeking, and granted, the protections of the U.S. Bankruptcy code. Further, Navy has repeatedly, and with what seems to be malice and purpose, incorrectly reported the disposition of my accounts to The Credit Bureaus. I have tried to resolve this by opening over XXXX investigations with each credit bureau, sending supporting documentation including bankruptcy orders, discharge orders, etc. to the credit bureaus, sending the same documentation to Navy as well as having my attorney contact Navy. Ultimately this has yielded "" 0 '' results, and the Credit Bureaus, despite my submission of supporting and explicit documentation, claims Navy has verified the reporting. It is my belief this constitutes a willful and purposeful intent to harm me as a consumer, and is a violation, at the very least of the FCRA, but may consist of even more severe violation of other laws and/or regulations. Navy has consistently incorrectly reported account on all XXXX of my reports in this way : '' Doubled '' accounts showing them twice, thus severely damaging my credit rebuildingHas reported accounts as being enrolled in a "" wage earner program '', which has never been the case, and has damaged my credit worthiness. Is reporting most accounts as closed XX/XX/XXXX, even though they should show closed in XX/XX/XXXX, which is severely damaging my credit rating. Has/Is reporting accounts as "" open and late '' as recently as XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. Navy refuses to respond to my written communication concerning these inaccuracies, and the credit bureaus are only willing to list what Navy tells them, despite my myriad documentation to the contrary. One of the great benefits of the Bankruptcy Code is that, for those citizens who deserve it, can make a "" fresh '' start. Contrary to the law and purpose of the process, I believe that Navy is purposely harming me as retribution for the losses they incurred in the Bankruptcy.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,NAVY FEDERAL CREDIT UNION,VA,222XX,None,Consent provided,Web,09/17/15,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,1569296
02/28/17,Bank account or service,Savings account,"Account opening, closing, or management",None,"I have had a savings account with TD Bank since 2011. Last week, based on a conversation with a bank teller at the following TD Bank , N.A . location ( XXXX, XXXX, PA XXXX ), I was told that the type of savings account I currently had ( interest rate of .15 % ) was no longer offered. I was also told that I should have been switched to a high yield interest savings account ( interest rate of .50 % ), however, no attempt by TD was made to communicate/switch the following : ( a ) communicate that my current savings account was no longer offered ( b ) communicate that I qualified for other savings accounts actively being offered ( all of which had higher interest rates ) ( c ) switch me into a savings account automatically that I qualified for. Additionally, as none of the current savings account offerings at TD had any major fees/restrictions, THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO REASON ANY CUSTOMER WOULD HAVE ANY ISSUE BEING SWITCHED INTO A HIGHER INTEREST RATE SAVINGS ACCOUNT. This suggests that TD Bank may be solely interested in their own financial gain at the expense of the customer who is kept in the dark. What makes matters worse is that I have qualified for high yield savings accounts since I opened an account in 2011 ( as no minimum balance is required ) ; certain years I was receiving the appropriate interest and other years I was not. I raised this concern with the XXXX/Store Manager who told me they would not compensate me for interest that I would have accrued during the years that my interest was sub .20 %. The irony is that I am only asking for the minimal interest I feel I am owed on the LARGE balance I maintain in my savings account and not the profit TD made reinvesting my money over the past 6 years which, I can assure you, is a much larger amount than the interest I would have received in the first place. In closing, although my primary concern is my own financial situation, this may be part of a much larger and potentially more serious issue whereby TD Bank is not being open and transparent about the status of their customers accounts ( e.g. when accounts are created/changed/no longer offered ) and the financial impact it may have on their customers. As we saw with XXXX ( where accounts were being created/cash was being moved to boost sales numbers without customer authorization/intervention ), my suggestion would be that you open a full investigation as to how TD manages their customers bank accounts and, perhaps more importantly, the extent to which they attempt to communicate the best banking services/solutions for their customers.",None,TD BANK US HOLDING COMPANY,PA,None,None,Consent provided,Web,02/28/17,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,2364183

Even though I continue to earn money I am paid via U.S. checks and despite trying every bank that I could reach - none of them would cash the check without me first opening a checking account. And although I have tried opening a checking account at more than 40 separate XXXX - I continued to be denied access to even the most basic checking or savings account. Generally speaking, these banks do not tell me why I am denied, just that they have made a business decision to not offer their services to me ( although I continue to receive targeted advertising offers in the mail, through email, etc. ) I have lived for a while now paying excessive fees to have my checks cashed via special check cashing businesses but the fees are outrageous and the time spent waiting for a check to clear is often in excess of 10 days. I am very much at my wits end because I am not sure what else to do. I have tried repairing my credit but due to an unresolved identity theft event that occurred in 2013 - I am having difficulty doing so. I have even gone through all the steps to correct my credit report but the various financial institutions will not remove the false information despite multiple police reports, affidavits, etc. Additionally, twice I have gone through the lengthy process of applying for a new Social Security Number and twice the Social Security Administration lost my paperwork. Without rambling on forever, I am attempting to resolve this situation by granting my Mother durable power of attorney rights in hopes that she will be able to sign and cash the checks I have received as well as provide basic banking services for me. In addition to the costs associated with paying check cashing processors, without a bank account I pay more for everything and am even denied by entire business sectors. For example, despite searching for months I have yet to find a health insurance provided that allows payment via cash, I am unable to take advantage of the savings associated with purchasing things online, I am barred from consumer services such as XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, etc - because I can not input a credit or debit card number, and I would say generally being without a checking account almost doubles the cost of living through increased prices, limited consumer services, and significant delays associated with cashing checks. In light of this, I would ask that Goldman Sachs Bank honor the attached durable power of attorney. My mother and I have previously attempted cooperate with our local bank on how to resolve this situation but the necessary documents and instructions required of us are vague and keep on changing. Thus I am writing this complaint in hopes to spur a resolution that would provide remediation the problems associated with being un-banked. Further, I wish for the bank to investigate whether the decision to deny me access to basic banking services has to do with the fact that I have reported fraud to the SEC, CFPB, and OCC concerning illicit account opening practices and BSA compliance failures.",None,GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA,CA,959XX,None,Consent provided,Web,02/21/17,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2353633

AND STOP XXXX AROUND WITH YOUR TACTICTS OF CRIMINAL DECEPTIVE BEHAVIOR, THAT AINT MY XXXX DEBT AND YOU KNOW IT!!! PARTS OF A LAWFUL CONTRACT 1. Parties competent to contract The parties to a contract should be competent, being of the age of consent, of sound mind, not disqualified from contracting by any law to which s/he is subject. A flaw in capacity may be due to minority, lunacy, idiocy, drunkenness or kind. The parties should be of like kind, being either artificial Legal Entity and artificial Legal Entity, or living Man/Woman and living Man/Woman, allowing more than two parties but never a mixture of these kinds. 2. Free and genuine consent The consent of the parties to the agreement must be free and genuine. The consent of the parties should not be obtained by misrepresentation, fraud, undue influence, coercion or mistake. If the consent is obtained by any of these means, then the contract is not valid or lawfully enforceable. 3. Full disclosure When negotiating a contract, full disclosure is the act of providing all material information, or telling the "" whole truth '', about any matter which may influence the decision-making of the other party or parties before they decide to enter into a contract. 4. Sufficient consideration The consideration is something of value possessed by the parties that is brought to the contract table. This something of value is bargained for and given in exchange for a promise or a performance. The parties must each receive a benefit and each suffer a detriment. To be enforceable, a contract must have sufficient consideration. A contract is unenforceable if it has insufficient or unequal consideration without agreement. 5. Certainty of terms The Terms and Conditions of the contract must be fully disclosed and agreed upon, and must be certain and fixed, i.e. not variable as with interest rates. 6. Meeting of the minds A meeting of the minds "" consensus ad idem '', occurs between the parties when they recognise each other, understand their mutual obligations, and agree.

The XXXX tier provides the client with certain perks such as a XXXX % bonus when redeeming cash rewards to a checking account, a interest booster on your savings account, in addition to other things. About XXXX months ago ( or more ) my wife and I rolled over a retirement account into XXXX XXXX to ensure that we met the XXXX threshold. The rollover was done with a Merrill XXXX representative who was informed what we were doing and the fact that the only reason we were rolling the funds over was to qualify for the program.

Each time I call it is a complete hassle ( and a waste ) as I have to also get my wife on the phone so she can verify her accounts before being able to speak to a representative. Initially, we were told that it took a couple of weeks more than the XXXX period to qualify, so we decided to wait a couple of weeks, and when nothing happened called again. We were then told that the reason why the accounts were not showing as qualifying for preferred rewards was because we needed to change my wife 's maiden to her new married last name ( something we should have been told months ago but were not ), so we submitted all the paperwork to have her last name changed and the representative informed me she would call me back in XXXX days. XXXX weeks later she had yet to call.
